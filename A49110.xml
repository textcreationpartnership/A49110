            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Deſign of this Treatiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove, that Schiſme is a work of the fleſh, it cannot be improper to ſubmit it to the cognizance of a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the Peace of the State being equally violated thereby, as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church; and, when the Veil of the Temple is rent, there uſually follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Earth-quake through the whole
<pb facs="tcp:99423:3"/>Land.—<hi>Turn tua res agitur:</hi> the ſame perſons that deſpiſe <hi>Aaron,</hi> do affront <hi>Moſes:</hi> And indeed in a Church and Kingdom ſo knit and conſolidated, as ours are, (Where the King is through God's good providence, a Nurſing-father to the Church, and not only profeſſeth himſelf to be of its communion, but hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obliged himſelf by Oath, to defend the rights and priviledges thereof, and to that end hath eſtabliſhed many good Laws, not only by Statute, but by Canons Eccleſiaſtical (which are alſo the King's Laws:) and where the Church on her part, as to external peace and order, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely acknowledgeth her dependance on the King, as Defender of the faith, which ſhe profeſſeth, and in all cauſes, and over all perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, ſupreme Moderator and Governor, and by the indiſpenſable Laws of God is ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the duty of Allegiance, that neither ſhe, nor any of her children ever did, nor can deny that, without denying their own Doctrine and Profeſſion: and long and certain experience hath taught us, that whoever retained themſelves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, did yield due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb facs="tcp:99423:3"/>to the King, and contrariwiſe as many as withdrew from the communion of the Church, were profeſſed enemies to the King) It is impoſſible, I ſay, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a Schiſme ſhould be maintained in ſuch a Church, without actual Sedition in the State. In this <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was right, when he called the Authors of a new Sect, Ring-leaders of Sedition, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a very pest; for Schiſme, like the Plague of Leproſie eats into the Walls and Timber of the Houſe; and as <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> obſerves of the Schiſme of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> what Family is there, where either the Wife is not withdrawn from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? or Children from their Parents? or Servants from their Maſters? And the Diviſions of private Families produce publick miſchiefs: for as a Family which conſiſts of divers perſons, being divided, cannot stand; ſo a Kingdom, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of divers Families, being divided, will come to ruine: as when the ſeveral twiſts of a Cable, which holds the Ship at Anchor, is by little Vermin eaten through, the ſhip is expoſed to the violence of every wind and ſtorm. When the Church loſeth a Member, the King doth not only loſe a
<pb facs="tcp:99423:4"/>ſubject, but gaineth an enemy: when either Lay-men make uſe of ſchiſmatical Meetings, or Religious men of ſeditiòus tumults, the peace of the Church and State are equally indangered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be denied, that the very act of ſeparation, is a bidding<note n="*" place="margin">Pertinaciae Schiſmatis non est alia ratio quam o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium fraternum.

                     </note> farewell to all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Opinions, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable converſation towards thoſe, from whom the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made: And when they who firſt ſeparated from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> did on the very ſame grounds diſſent from the brethren of that ſeparation, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into new Sects, they were profeſſed enemies unto all, but that Faction to which they adhered: For no ſeparation is held juſtifiable, but from ſuch, in whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion the diſſenters do apprehend (at leaſt) that they cannot ſerve God as they ought, but that they ſhould ſin in doing as the rules of that communion do require. And if ſo, how ſhould they ſcruple to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the King's Laws, when they think them contrary to God's Laws? or how ſhould they care to be at peace with them,
<pb facs="tcp:99423:4"/>who are in their apprehenſions enemies to truth? Their hatred will rather increaſe, and become implacable, and they will call it Zeal, how bitter and fierce ſoever it be. For when Men think their opinions and paſſions warranted by Religion, they alſo think themſelves bound, by their greatest hopes and fears, to proſecute them to the utmost of their power: and as the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Diſciples did, to call for fire from Heaven, on all thoſe that diſſent from them, and that they ſhould do God good ſervice in ſlaying of them. The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have been raiſed among us about things indifferent, have cauſed the loſs of more of the bloud and ſpirits of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as of true piety, than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of all its profeſſed enemies: Long have we languiſhed under that iſſue of bloud, which was opened by punctilio's of Religion: for our controverſies did not concern the fundamentals of Religion, but only the dreſs and garments of external worſhip, and yet how great a matter did a little fire kindle, when it was blown from a coal taken from the Altar? for they who, as the Prieſts of God, ſhould <hi>weep between the Porch and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb facs="tcp:99423:5"/>Joel 2.17.</hi> and not only by their tears, but by their bloud too, endeavour to extinguiſh the flame, did as the Prieſts of <hi>Mars</hi> ſcatter fire in every corner of the Temple, and warmed themſelves at the flames, which they had kindled. What if the matters contended for were vile, and inconſiderable? they had the Art to ſet them off by glorious Names— The Cauſe and Covenant of God, the Kingdome and Scepter of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and in ſuch a cauſe, they are bound, as they think, not only to leave, but in a literal ſenſe, to hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother: All moderation is luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, and they will be cruel, that they may not be accounted cold, as the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> foretold, <hi>p. 69.</hi> of his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Many perſons do at this day look upon <hi>The Covenant,</hi> as a holy and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Inſtrument for Reformation, but who among all the Covenanters was there, that did not think himſelf bound to oppoſe the King in reforming the Church? But I am ſure, ſays that <hi>Royal Perſon,</hi> The right method of reforming the Church, cannot conſist with that of diſturbing the State, nor can Religion be juſtly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by depreſſing Loyalty, which is one of
<pb facs="tcp:99423:5"/>the chiefest ingredients and ornaments of true Religion, for next to <hi>Fear God,</hi> is <hi>Honour the King:</hi> and yet no Artillery Yard did ever diſcipline more Men for War, nor any Magazine furniſh them with keener Weapons, than the Tongues and Pens of ſome Diſciplinarians have done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would willingly be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what company of perſons in any Age, did openly ſeparate from an Eſtabliſhed Church, wherein they might ſerve God without ſinning by communicating with it, and did not alſo trouble and diſturb the State.</p>
                  <p>The multitude cannot look through the Vizor and ſee how they are acted by the ambition and covetouſneſs of a few male-contents, who under a ſeeming Zeal for the Truth, have real deſigns againſt peace: and do expoſe the Temporal and Eternal welfare of their followers, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of their own ungodly Luſts: not unlike the Ape that burnt the Cats foot in the fire to pluck out her beloved Nuts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nor can it be otherwiſe thought but that Schiſmatical perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us do drive Seditious deſigns, if it be conſidered, that there is no pious duty or laudable exerciſe of piety and devotion, but it may be done more ſolemnly in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, than in any private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles whatſoever.<note n="*" place="margin">Non licet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

It is beyond queſtion, that there may be ſuch corruptions in Doctrine, and ſuch Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous practices required in Worſhip, as may juſtifie a Separation; but neither of theſe can be pretended againſt our Church. The Covenanters indeed did pretend a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reforming our Doctrine, but to this day have not mentioned any one Article, that needed it; but while the Covenant was warm upon their Spirits, they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all perſons admitted into any Benefice ſhould ſubſcribe our Articles,
<pb facs="tcp:99423:6"/>having firſt read them publickly, and profeſſed their conſent to them, as long as the Houſe of Lords had the Power of admiſſion committed to them; and even now in cool bloud, all parties that have any thing of Sobriety do make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Standard by which they authorize their own. And if the preſent Diſſenters were Chriſtians indeed, the great and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Fundamentals of Religion wherein they agree with us in judgment, might reconcile their affections in thoſe leſſer things, wherein they differ. <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionum diverſitas &amp; Opinantium uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non ſunt</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>Hales</hi> of Schiſm, <hi>p. 215.</hi> How unreaſonable and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing it is to contend for Ceremonies to the neglect of the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith, is I hope ſatisfactorily evinced in another diſcourſe hereunto annexed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I ſhall therefore propoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Argument to prove that Schiſm as it is now practiſed among us, is inſeparable from Sedition, becauſe if men did diſſent purely upon the account of Judgment, and Conſcience, they would diſſent ſoberly
<pb facs="tcp:99423:7"/>and peaceably, and as the Nonconformiſts in Mr. <hi>Balls</hi> days joyn with us in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things which they cannot but allow, though they refuſed to communicate in other things which they ſuſpected; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things alſo, they would in all humility and meekneſs ſeek ſatisfaction, and diſtruſt their own Opinions, which they find to be contrary to the judgment of their Superiours whom they cannot but acknowledge to be very learned and good men. For as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on <hi>Romans 14. Dignitatis ratio poſcit, ut imperitior peritiori obtemperet,</hi> We owe ſo much to the Authority and wiſdom of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours that in things doubtful and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected (and he inſtanceth in things far more obnoxious than our Ceremonies) they who have leſs knowledge ought to obey him that hath more; and he gives this reaſon, becauſe if it be a crime of Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, to deſpiſe the Superſtition of the weak, and of him that erreth in Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; of how much more intolerable Arrogance is it, if he that is more weak in Faith and Knowledge, do judge and condemn them, that are better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? according to the vulgar rule of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb facs="tcp:99423:7"/>perſons, who judge all unjuſt which themſelves do not practiſe: and the Apoſtle tells ſuch that <hi>the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, (i. e.)</hi> the ſpirit and temper of the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in being ſolicitous about ſuch things which are left to our Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but about the promoting of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and peace,</hi>

                     <hi>and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> which are indiſpenſably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; ſo that ſober and conſcientious Diſſenters, would rather according to the Will of God ſuffer patiently for well-doing, than ſtudiouſly promote diſcord and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all thoſe evils which the Apoſtle ſays do accompany it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot forbear to commend that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent advice of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> to ſuch perſons. <hi>Epiſtle 56.</hi> If thou art que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned (ſaith he) concerning points of ſubtilty and controverſies, tell them, thou knoweſt not what to Anſwers, becauſe thy Learning lyeth not that way; if thou art urged to declare what thou knoweſt, and wherein thy learning lyeth, <hi>Reſponde, to noſſe, quomodo ſine iſtis, homo poſſit eſſe beatus.</hi> Anſwer thou, I have learned how a man may be happy without
<pb facs="tcp:99423:8"/>the underſtanding of ſuch points. And Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> obſerved that when ſcruples of Conſcience began to be made or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then Schiſms began to break in. <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Schiſm, p. 217.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now let any indifferent man judge; concerning ſuch as inſtead of diſſenting peaceably and ſeeking ſatisfaction meekly, in ſuch punctilio's, of the nature of which they may be ſafely ignorant, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of ſome of their queſtions, refer the reſolution of them until <hi>Elias</hi> come, do not only renounce all Communion in the eſtabliſhed Worſhip; but contrary to the known Laws of God, and the King, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the publick peace, rail at their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, defame and reſiſt their Superiors, are deaf to all arguments, and will not be perſwaded when they are over-convinced, but inſtead of patiently enduring what is not in their power to amend, as <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> adviſeth, do with equal pride and impatience attempt the caſting off of all Government, whether ſuch are men of tender Conſciences, or of carnal, and by conſequence of Seditious principles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Which will yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb facs="tcp:99423:8"/>appear, if it be conſidered that Schiſms are ordinarily contrived, and abetted, by diſcontented and ambitious perſons, whoſe ſeditious and Traiterous deſigns againſt the State, do want the Midwifry of Schiſm, to give them Birth and Maturity. The <hi>Vow at Hebron</hi> was a means to form an Army againſt <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7.</note> and <hi>Come ſee my zeal,</hi> the Motto of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s standard,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16.</note> which drew many after them, who went in the ſimplicity of their hearts to their own destruction. And if mens practiſes may be judged of by their principles, the doctrines that are infuſed into the ſpirits of the people at ſuch meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, will ſufficiently prove that their deſigns are ſeditious. For when men do extol their new Diſcipline as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Scepter of Chriſt, and affirm that all the Scepters of the Earth must bow to it, or be broken in pieces; that Dominion is founded in grace; that wicked men are Uſurpers and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all that they have, and it is no more robbery to deprive them of it than for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to rob the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> when they aſſert the nullity of former Oaths for obedience to lawful powers by
<pb facs="tcp:99423:9"/>framing New Covenants, and impoſing on the ſubjects contrary to the command of their lawful Prince; that good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may justifie unlawful actions, and they may do evil that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that Chriſtian liberty doth free the Believing wife from the unbelieving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the godly child from his ungodly Parents, and the faithful ſervant from his Infidel master; When their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of curſing and lyes, deſpiſing Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpeaking evil of Dignities, vindictive groans againſt their Brethren, complaints of the decay of Religion, of oppreſſion of the Godly, curſing all Neuters that do not help them againſt the Lords Anointed, or that do their work negligently, and withhold their Swords from bloud: How ſpiritual ſoever ſuch men may be thought, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their warfare are carnal <hi>(i.e.)</hi> they are ſeditious; ſuch men are not Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Goſpel of Peace, but of the <hi>Evangelium Armatum,</hi> every line whereof as <hi>Draco</hi>'s Laws is written in bloud. When King <hi>Richard</hi> the First had taken priſoner a Biſhop, that was in Arms againſt him, the Pope ſends to him to deliver his Son, but the King
<pb facs="tcp:99423:9"/>ſends the Pope the Biſhops Armour, and asketh him if that were his Sons coat? I would fain know of them that profeſs themſelves the children of Peace, if theſe be the garments of their Ghostly Fathers that begat them. The great ſorcereſs <hi>Medea</hi> perſwaded the daughters of <hi>Peleus,</hi> that the way to recover their aged Father to youth and strength was to cut him in pieces and boyl him according to her Art. None but a people that have been bewitched could be perſwaded that the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore our Church to strength and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was to divide it into ſo many ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sects.</p>

                  <head>The <hi>Picture</hi> of <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (calls it in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and) deſcribes it in the 4th. Book of his Inſtitutions, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Section</hi> 16th.</head>
                  <p>ALthough this Temptation (of refuſing to Communicate with others, becauſe we judge them wicked) may ſometime invade good Men, through an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate zeal for Holineſs; yet we ſhall find that this too great moroſity doth ariſe rather from pride and diſdain, and a falſe opinion of Sanctity, than from true Piety, or an endeavour after it: Wherefore they that are more audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than others to make Separation from the Church, and are as Standard-bearers, they for the moſt part have no other reaſon, than that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all, they may ſhew themſelves better than others. Wherefore <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſays well, and prudently, Whereas
<pb facs="tcp:99423:14"/>the good frame and manner of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Diſcipline ought eſpecially to reſpect the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, which the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be mutually preſerved by long-ſuffering, and which not being preſerved, the application of Medicine is not only ſuperfluous, but dangerous; and ſo can never produce the effect of a Medicine; They are wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who not ſo much through hatred of other Men's iniquities, as by a love of their own contentions, do affect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to withdraw, or at leaſt to divide the weak People, whom they have inſnared by the reputation of their Names. Theſe are ſwollen with pride, furious in their perverſneſs, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in calumnies, turbulent in ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, uſing a ſhadow of rigid ſeverity, leſt it ſhould appear that they want the light of truth. And thoſe things which are commanded in the Scripture to be done with all moderation, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the faults of our Brethren, (the ſincerity of Love, and unity of Peace being ſtill preſerved) they make uſe of, for the Sacrilege of Schiſme, and an occaſion of Separation. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:99423:14"/>to good and peaceable Men he gives this Counſel, <hi>That they mercifully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect what they may,</hi> and <hi>patiently bear with what they cannot amend,</hi> and <hi>in love bewail and lament, until God do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and correct all, or at the Harveſt do root out the Weeds, and winnow the Chaff.</hi> With theſe Weapons all good Men ſtudy to arm themſelves, leſt while they ſeem ſtout and reſolute Champions of Holineſs, they revolt from the Kingdom of God, which is the only Kingdom of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>For, becauſe God hath choſen to have the Communion of his Church obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this external ſociety; He who through hatred of the wicked, ſhall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Symbol of that Society, doth enter into that Path, wherein a falling from the Communion of Saints is moſt obvious.</p>

                  <p>IT was not long ſince, that the Sins of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege</hi> were ſo <hi>ſucceſsful,</hi> that they did not only caſt off their old names, but commenced <hi>Vertues;</hi> and it was dangerous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whether there were ſuch ſins or no: Proſperous wickedneſs hath never wanted its Apologiſts, who know how to call evil good, and good evil. The caſe is almoſt the ſame, concerning the Sin of <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Separation:</hi> And now men queſtion, whether there be any ſuch thing, as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they make no queſtion of ſeparating from it: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that there was a Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> that there was <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying,</hi> and <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> among them, and that they were but <hi>carnal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellers,
<pb facs="tcp:99423:16"/>that were the Authors of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; Yet theirs were but venial, in reſpect of ours, which I know not whether I may call Mortal, or Immortal diſcords; for when we hoped that the chief Authors being laid in their Graves, their practices would have been buried with them, and that we who had laboured in the fire of Contention, and ſuffered under the diſmal effects of it, for Twenty Years together, would have trembled at every ſpark of it; Behold, how like the <hi>Infelix lolium,</hi> like <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Hemlock,</hi> the Seeds of Diſſention are grown up in every Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Field, and thoſe ſparks are blown up into ſuch Flames, as have ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, if not upon all, yet upon the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Houſes of God in the Land. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were but Children in this work; they wrangled about their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as Boys about their Maſters, who was the beſt Teacher among them: <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> who (as the Scholiaſt obſerves) was their firſt Biſhop, had a conſiderable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if they did rob <hi>Peter,</hi> it was to cloath <hi>Paul;</hi> but with us nothing will ſerve, but a total extirpation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Paſtors of the Church, to raiſe a Presbytery upon their ruines: And yet
<pb facs="tcp:99423:16"/>Men will not be perſwaded there is any ſuch ſin as Schiſme in the Land; or at leaſt think themſelves much injured, if it be imputed to them. If Men would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent peaceably, and (according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles rule, Rom. <hi>14.22. Haſt thou faith,</hi> (that is an opinion of the lawfulneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of Rites and Cuſtomes in the Church) <hi>have it to thy ſelf before God)</hi> not propagate their private Opinions, to the diſturbance of the publick peace, they might deſerve that indulgence, which his moſt Gracious Majeſty hath allowed them; but when they ſhall practically condemn themſelves, and pragmatically miſguide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in oppoſing thoſe things, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have allowed; the Apoſtle accounts them unhappy men, as having the brand of Hereticks, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, viſibly upon them, by continuing obſtinately in that error, which themſelves, as well as the Churches of God have exploded.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſeparated Miniſters, the more learned and ſober of them, did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent our Aſſemblies, joyn with us in our Liturgies and Communion; though in the quality of lay Men; and I cannot doubt, but that they were well aſſured, that it was their duty ſo to do, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb facs="tcp:99423:17"/>others, to the publick worſhip of God ſo celebrated. If it was their duty to frequent it then, it cannot be their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but their ſin, not only to deſert, but to create a ſcorn and contempt of it now, and by erecting a Babel of confuſion, ſeek to down with Sion, <hi>down with it to the ground.</hi> I have only this query to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſuch, Whether, if they did well in communicating with us themſelves, they do not ill in withdrawing others from our Communion? I believe it is their own judgment, as well as mine, that if they might be diſpenſed with, as to the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Covenant, Reordination, Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> the <hi>Surplice</hi> and the <hi>Croſs,</hi> they might then conform to our Liturgy and Diſcipline, and few of them would ſcruple to conform, as publick Miniſters in all other things. Why then do thoſe very Men, (ſome of which have publiſhed as much to the World, and the moſt part are convinced in Judgment and Conſcience, that they themſelves might thus conform) why do they ſo induſtriouſly ſeduce the People from their duty of communicating in their ſeveral Pariſhes, with their own Miniſters, ſeeing that none of them are concerned in the things which are ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
<pb facs="tcp:99423:17"/>at, in order to the conformity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſters? They are not troubled with <hi>Covenant, Reordination,</hi> &amp;c. nor with any thing, that hath ſo much as a colour of juſtifying a Separation. I am heartily ſorry, that any Perſons have ſo intangled themſelves, in Nets of their own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that they cannot, without loſs of their <hi>reputation,</hi> diſingage themſelves; but that loſs is not ſo great, as the miſchief will be, if they ſhall inſnare others, and ſeek to ſalve their own reputation, by the <hi>hazard</hi> of the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore, I beſeech you, where the blame and <hi>guilt</hi> will lye; if on your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices, the People whom you have ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wherein they might ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, with reverence and godly fear, ſhall within a ſhort time forſake your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies alſo, and unite themſelves to other Teachers, and Conventicles, in which they think (whether right or wrong) they may ſerve God in <hi>purer Ordinances,</hi> and at laſt, to live <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; if theſe Deluſions do ſpring from your Principles and practices, as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly they do, Is not the guilt of all theſe Confuſions imputable to you, and may not
<pb facs="tcp:99423:18"/>the loſs of thoſe Souls be required at your hands? If therefore in ſome private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, there be a <hi>Vae ſi non,</hi> a woe unto you, if you preach not; there may be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the publick, a <hi>Vae</hi> infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if Men ſhall ſtill go on in the <hi>way of Kain, and run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and periſh in the gain-ſaying of Core.</hi> It is not the ſpot of a Servant of God, but an indelible brand, which the Spirit of God hath fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that <hi>he made Iſrael to ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In our Polemical Debates with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it hath been our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, that as ſoon as we have beaten them out of one ſtrong hold, they have fled to another, from their <hi>Univerſality,</hi> and conſtancy in the received faith, to the Spirit of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> annexed to the Succeſſion of their <hi>Popes,</hi> either perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or <hi>in Cathedrâ,</hi> with his Conclave, or in a <hi>Council;</hi> when theſe were ſhattered, they retreat to their inviſible Fort of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;</hi> but when all theſe have by the Canon of Scripture, and Apoſtolical Men, been ſo levelled to the ground, that ſcarce one ſtone is left upon another; we ſee the Grandeur, and <hi>Temporal Principality</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:99423:18"/>of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is at the bottom, which the Sword of the Spirit, and the Weapons of Chriſtianity, in the hands of Men, are not able to remove. It is even ſo, in our Controverſies with Separatiſts: when their pretences of <hi>Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian Government,</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious Rites,</hi> an <hi>imperfect Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,</hi> have been confuted, they retreat to other pretences, of having <hi>purer Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> of preſerving their Chriſtian <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> and freedom of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which admit of nothing to be impoſed, as to the Worſhip of God, but what is expreſſed in his Word: when the weakneſs of theſe are diſcovered, there is ſomething ſtill at the bottom, <hi>(viz.)</hi> They would be <hi>uppermoſt;</hi> they cannot forgo their reputation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary knowledge, and Zeal for God, which alone can bear them out in their former actions, and make the People ſtill believe, that what they did, was according to Conſcience, and not upon deſign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. The contrary whereof will by this Diſcourſe, appear to be the ground of all Separations from any Church ſo duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, as our Church of <hi>England</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, there are great ſins
<pb facs="tcp:99423:19"/>amongſt us; we grant it, and do not only importune God, for his Names ſake to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our <hi>iniquities, for they are great,</hi> but wiſh for more aſſiſtance, for amending of them: we are unwilling to recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as the Prophet <hi>Oded</hi> did, <hi>2 Chron. 28.9, 10. Are there not with you, even with you alſo, ſins againſt the Lord your God?</hi> I ſhall rather commend to you that ancient <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb, <hi>Deus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus aſpicit, &amp; tegit; Vicinus vero nilvidet, &amp; tamen nil niſi naevos crepat.</hi> The moſt high God ſees all our iniquities, and he covers them all; we that ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon, are always blaming, and troubling our Neighbours. <hi>If the Contagion of ſin hath invaded the Multitude,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſevere mercy of Divine Diſcipline is neceſſary to cure us: but the counſel, and enterpriſe of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both vain and pernicious, yea ſacrilegious; becauſe, ſuch are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Pride and wickedneſs, as that they do ever trouble the good, which are weak, more than chaſtiſe the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, which are wicked.</hi> None of us can be ignorant of the prejudices and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, that are raiſed by ſuch practices, in the generality of the people, of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb facs="tcp:99423:19"/>ſoever: Your Diſciples do <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> cenſure them from whom they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, as <hi>profane, carnal, cruel,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable</hi> Men. They again do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſome among you are diſcontented and <hi>implacable, proud</hi> and <hi>ambitious;</hi> and ſuch as deſerve that black character, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath given, <hi>2 Tim. 3.2, 3, 4, verſes,</hi> &amp;c. And by theſe conteſts we weaken our ſelves, harden and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate our grand enemies, and give them great advantages againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore rather <hi>follow the things that make for peace,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we may <hi>edify one another,</hi> for we cannot but know, after ſo long and ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as we have had, that theſe things will be <hi>bitterneſs in the latter end;</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſerve that character, which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives of a peaceable man, <hi>Quiſquis vel quod poteſt arguendo corrigit, vel quod corrigere non poteſt, (ſalvo pacis vinculo) excludit, vel quod (ſalvo pacis vinculo) excludere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, equitate improbat, firmitate ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portat, hic pacificus eſt,</hi> Ad Parmen. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> And again, <hi>The things which are evil diſpleaſe all good Men, and they hinder, and ſuppreſs them as much as
<pb facs="tcp:99423:20"/>they may, but when they may not, they endure, and grieve for them, and for peace's ſake, laudably tolerate, what they do not think laudable but damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor do they forſake the Field of Chriſt, becauſe of the Weeds, nor his Floor, for the Chaff, nor the great Houſe of God, becauſe of ſome leſs honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Veſſels that are therein.</hi> If I ſeem to contend too earneſtly, and rebuke too ſharply, it was not my nature or indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the ſubject that prompted me to it. Some Grounds will produce Briers and Thorns, though the Husbandman uſe his utmoſt care to prevent them. The good <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> uſed Wine, as well as Oyl, on the Man that was caſually wounded, going from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho;</hi> And when the Prince of Peace dealt with the ſeducing and ſacrilegious Phariſees, that lay in wait to divert poor ſouls, and would neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the way of peace, nor ſuffer them that were entring, to go therein; he acts like a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> and denounceth Hell and Damnation, <hi>Matth. 23.33.</hi> from which the good Lord deliver us all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Artiſts, who have very good skill in painting, will deſcribe a <hi>Separatist</hi> in the form of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop, ſuch as <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> or <hi>Ridley,</hi> who left the Communion of the Papacy, and retained no reſemblance of his Fatherhood the <hi>Pope,</hi> or of that Step-mother the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Separation is indeed ſuch a deformed and illegitimate birth, that it is never acknowledged by its own Parents, but laid at other Mens Doors; And it concerns us to enquire, who are the peccant Parties, that we may clear our ſelves from the charge and imputation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then we ſay, that we have no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that Church hath ſeparated from the Faith of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99423:25"/>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtolical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Worſhip. If there be any thing truly ancient and Catholick in that Church, the ſame is ſtill legible in every part of our conſtitution; we have forſaken the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and innovations, which of later Years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded that Church; and the time, manner, and methods, by which ſtrange Doctrines, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, <hi>like Hay and Stuble,</hi> were laid on the ancient Foundation, ſo that the whole Building is become another Babel, for confuſion and corruption have been particularly diſcovered.

And it is ſtrange how they who are moſt forward to blame the Church, for not following preciſely the words of Chriſt in other Inſtitutions, can quarrel as her (as they do) for obſerving them in this, when-as without theſe words, that power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be duly and authoritatively derived. It is true, that the Church not ſeeing the hearts of Men, may confer this authority on unworthy Men, but ſo did Chriſt <hi>(who knew all that was in his heart)</hi> on <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe Miniſtry was authentick, though his Perſon was vile: he might be an inſtrument of ſaving others, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being a <hi>Caſt-away.</hi> If they that ſeparate are partakers of this Holy Calling, they are beholding to the ordinary Paſtors of the Church for it, from whom they now ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and this will but aggravate their guilt.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99423:40"/>inferior in external Gifts and Learning to them that do ſeparate, (the contrary whereof is notoriouſly known) yet the bleſſing of God is appropriated to the Miniſtry of thoſe, whom he hath ſent and commiſſioned thereunto: And therefore they cannot, in the ſecond place, with the leaſt probability pretend to a <hi>greater meaſure</hi> of the <hi>ſanctifying</hi> graces of the Spirit, notwithſtanding their talk of the perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Holy Ghoſt. It is true, that <hi>he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. not eſſentially the ſame ſpirit with the Lord, but myſtically by the influence of that ſpirit, which renders him humble and holy, meek and gentle, loving and obedient, which graces of the ſpirit being eminently in Chriſt, are in ſome good meaſure communicated to all his ſanctified Members,<note place="margin">Eph 4.16.</note> that are united to his Body: which graces whether they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound moſt in Separatiſts, or thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in the Communion of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches, will appear anon. In the mean time, we ſhall proſecute our Enquiry, whether they that ſeparate have any ſuch <hi>extraordinary inſpirations</hi> and revelations of the Spirit, as they pretend unto: For certain it is, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Separatiſts of all perſwaſions do boaſt of ſome ſuch extraordinary influences, which yet keep them at as great a diſtance among themſelves, as from the true Church of God; let them therefore agree which of them have theſe effects from the true Spirit of God: In the mean time we ſhall make it appear, that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99423:40"/>none of them can have any ſuch Operations: Each Faction proclaiming the other to be, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ratione Philoſophos, ſine viſione Prophetas, ſine miſſione Apoſtolos, ſine inſtructione didaſcalos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Papiſts</hi> ought to have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who challenge more than a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Revelations. They chain the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of infallibility to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Chair, ſo that whatever he pronounceth <hi>ex Cathedrâ,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, muſt be received with equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and credit, as if it had been evidently commanded by the written Word. Yea, though it ſhould differ from ſome plain Doctrines therein delivered; for ſo do many of the <hi>Trent</hi> Articles, as Purgatory, and Prayers to Saints and Angels, and Tranſubſtantiation; which either owe their original to pretended Revelations, or at leaſt have no better proof for the confirmation of them. But certainly, the Infallible Spirit cannot contradict it ſelf: and when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays one thing, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Succeſſors affirm the contrary; when <hi>Nicolas</hi> the 4th. defines contrary to Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22th. they were not both infallible. If ſuch a Church can juſtly claim any ſpirit, it is the <hi>spirit of contradiction,</hi> as when it owns the Revelation of St. <hi>Bridget,</hi> that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was not conceived in Original Sin, and the Revelation of St. <hi>Catharine,</hi> that ſhe was: and inſtitutes a Holy-day to celebrate her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, upon ſuch a fabulous contradicted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Yet not only the obſervation of days, the Canonization of Saints, the foundation of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99423:41"/>many Orders in that Church, as of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> by <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the <hi>Franciſcans, Benedictines,</hi> and others, but even Articles of Faith have had their riſe from ſuch pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>If any of our Sectaries that pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, are willing to know their Fathers, or to find out a Church, with which they may hold Communion, now that they are departed from us, I think the very worſt among them may find a Founder and Foundation in no meaner Church than the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And did the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to diſclaim and diſcountenance all fanatick <hi>Factions,</hi> and manifeſt their folly to all Men, it would appear that there are more Sects, and they as errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Doctrine, and vicious in their Lives, as any in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> but as long as they own his Supremacy, and ſerve the intereſt of his Court, it is not much conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what becomes of the Goſpel, and the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to run a Parallel betwixt our Sectarie, and ſuch as have been, or ſtill are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who run beyond the Line of the greateſt Separatiſts that are among us.</p>

                  <p>Have we ſome, who by ſeeking God in Prayer, pretend to receive immediate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their doubts, and direction in all

                  <p>Have we ſome that ſlight the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and talk of <hi>immediate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes</hi> of the Spirit, to which they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attend; that talk of ſuch a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in which they cannot ſin; of living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ordinances and Duties?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99423:47"/>the Church of God Militant, and are now added to the Church Triumphant, from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Reformation, as from any National Church, of the like extent, ever ſince the Apoſtles days: nor did any <hi>of the noble army of Martyrs,</hi> and Confeſſors, now in Heaven, hold Communion with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtabliſhed Church, while they were Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant here below.

                  <p>Now if we may not only communicate with this Church without ſin, but have all things neceſſary to a holy and happy life adminiſtred, it muſt be levity and inconſtancy, ſome carnal, ſenſual, or worſe deſigns, that hurry us to a Separation.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99423:49"/>Vertues and comelineſs were inferior to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And as for the ordinary ſort of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Proſelytes, they were doubtleſs poſſeſt with an opinion of an eaſier Religion, that would indulge them in more licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and at eaſie rates grant them pardon for ſins to come, as well as what were paſt. Moſt Men would chooſe a Religion, which they may injoy with their Luſts, and wherein they may hope to go to Heaven, without that ſtrictneſs of life, and ſincere and univerſal obedience, which is required in the Proteſtant Churches. And it is altogether as evident, that many who divide themſelves into leſſer Factions among us, (though purity, and conſcience, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty be pretended) do pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſome other apprehenſions, than what are really conſiſtent with the graces of the Holy Spirit: of which I ſhall inſtance in theſe particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are <hi>Animalia Gloriae,</hi> ſo they were deſcribed by <hi>Tertullian: Qui gloriae &amp; principatus gratia,</hi>

How often and irrefragably did St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confute the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> yet could he not ſilence them, but being puft up with a furious pride, did ſtill boaſt that they alone were the Church of God, when as there was not any one Doctrine in the Catholick Church that they could juſtly cavil at. The ſame pride is obſerved in our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> who though there be not any Doctrine maintained in our Church, but ſome famous Doctors of their own have defended; nor any refuſed by us, but ſome very learned Men of their own have confuted the ſame: yet do they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for Hereticks, and notwithſtanding the infinite contradictions among themſelves, pretend ſtill to a ſpirit of infallibility. And if it be conſidered by impartial, and unintereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Perſons, how many eminent Men in our Church, for learning, piety, and moderation, have been cauſleſly, impudently, and unceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99423:51"/>vexed, reviled and oppoſed, by fierce, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and unreaſonable Men; it will appear, they are acted by no other ſpirit, but that of contradiction and perverſneſs, which manifeſts it ſelf in all their practices and writings, and proves them profeſſed enemies to all good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order. I cannot think <hi>Abailar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> was a wiſe Man, that reſolved to perſiſt in his Opinion, when he was convinced that all the Fathers were againſt him;<note place="margin">Qui cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de remoto, Gaudet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſque.</note> nor that ſuch Boys as <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of, that caſt off their Tutors, and become ungovernable, will ever make wiſe or good Men.</p>

They are indeed unſatisfied not only with their own, but with other Mens conditions. Thus as our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle obſerves, they <hi>go in the way of Cain,</hi> who envyed his Brother on no other account, but becauſe his perſon and ſervices were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Thus <hi>Aerius</hi> being denied a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, for which he was Competitor with a more worthy Perſon, vented his Opinion, that a Biſhop and Presbyter did differ in nothing;<note place="margin">St. Auguſt. de Haereſ. ad Quod vult Deuxe, <hi>69.</hi>
                     </note> hoping that though he could not raiſe himſelf to that dignity, he might degrade it to his own quality.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99423:52"/>Schiſme, and adds Hereſie to it. When ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Men meet with a repulſe, and their pride hath not that vent, and airy applauſe, which it expected, it ſpends it ſelf in envious and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thoughts; and as Cowards when they are deſperate, grow valiant, ſo are diſcontented perſons, to their own ruine, if not of the Church, that they may, if it be poſſible, do as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did, bury their Adverſaries under the ſame ruine that they draw upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

They that forſake the Aſſemblies, do provoke to ſomewhat elſe, than to love and good works. And how dwelleth the love of God in them,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20.</note> that profeſs ſuch contempt and hatred of their Brethren?

We may not wonder then, if Men that are perſwaded (as in all Factions there may be ſome) that they know more of the will of God, and injoy more of the love, and of the ſpirit of God, than others do, think it their duty, to act more for the glory of God, as well in ſuppreſſing the perſwaſions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as in propagating their own, and then act as violently as <hi>Saul,</hi> or any of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees ever did. Nor can the Heathen do, or ſuffer more for the ſervice of their Idols, than ſome Chriſtians have in the worſhip of their fond and falſe imaginations.</p>
                  <p>But all the active Zealots in a Faction, are not really perſwaded, that their Religion is the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99423:55"/>beſt, there are ſome, that with the Phariſees, make it only a pretence to other deſigns of Pride and Vain-glory, Avarice and Luxury, Malice and Revenge. They <hi>faſt,</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>pay tithes,</hi> and <hi>give almes,</hi> and all, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our obſerves, <hi>to be ſeen of men:</hi> and <hi>they have their reward;</hi> (that is) the vain applauſe which they aimed at. And as thoſe that are dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in deluding others by a cunning and nimble turn of their hands, are greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not only with the gain that they get, but with the eaſie methods and activity, by which they cauſe the common People to admire them: So many Impoſtors do greatly pleaſe themſelves, to ſee by what ſleights,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.14.</note> and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning craftineſs, as by divers Winds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they can carry ſome weak Chriſtians to and fro, whitherſoever it pleaſeth them.</p>
                  <p>What is pleaſure, but the ſatisfying and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of thoſe Luſts, Opinions and Humors, to which we devote our ſelves, and which have gotten a Dominion and Power over us? And this makes that variety and difference of pleaſure, that is in the World, anſwerable to the conſtitutions, education, cuſtome, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of Men. It would be a torment to a ſober, as well as to a pious Man, to wallow in ſuch unclean and beaſtly Luſts, wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think themſelves very happy. Thoſe that are <hi>Sanguine</hi> and Jovial, are delighted with <hi>fleſhly lusts, chambering, and wantonneſs,</hi> an Hawk, or Hound, or what is worſe: The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99423:56"/>
                     <hi>Cholerick</hi> take pleaſure in doing <hi>miſchief,</hi> vexing and diſquieting of others, though to their own great trouble; and they that are <hi>melancholy,</hi> in growing froward, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at every ſuppoſed fault, that agrees not with their fancies. Now of what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſoever theſe Men be, if they have not true grace, and the power of godlineſs, to mortifie theſe Luſts, and change their Natures, all their religious exerciſes will be made but a pretence, and an Engine the better to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their ſenſual deſigns. And like ſome platted Pictures, which at your firſt entrance to a Room, preſent you with the face of a Man, by that time that you have walkt about it, you ſee nothing but a Beaſt or a Serpent. A famous painter was once deſired to deſcribe an Horſe and his Rider, tumbling on the Ground together. He draws the Horſe ſtretching himſelf in a full career, the Rider ſitting cloſe, bowing himſelf to the very Mane, forcing him on with all his might, and ſcarce Man or Horſe to be ſeen, for the Cloud of Duſt which they raiſed, at the ſight whereof, he was told, that he had miſtaken the deſign: No, ſays the Painter, and with a turn of his hand, reverſing the picture, there appeared the Man and Horſe grovelling on the Ground, wallowing in the Duſt, and the Beaſt uppermoſt. He that would deſcribe a ſenſual Perſon, needs not borrow from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Rich</hi> Glutton, nor the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99423:56"/>Son,</hi> ſeeding with the Swine; I ſuppoſe it may be better done, by the Hiſtory of <hi>Jehu</hi> the Son of <hi>Nimſhi,</hi> a Perſon known by his furious marching. The Trumpet by which he gathered and animated his Troops, was his own Mouth, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> whereas the Kingdome was in his Eye. And to that he is reſolved to wade through the Bloud-Royal of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.</hi> To this end, as he prevents all addreſſes to King <hi>Joram,</hi> ſo he is deaf to all the Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Peace, and imbrues his hands, not only in the Blood of his Soveraign, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Heads of <hi>Seventy</hi> of the Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> to be cut off; and all his great Men,<note place="margin">2 Kings 10.1.</note> and his Kinſmen, and his prieſts,<note place="margin">v. 11.</note> and <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Forty</hi> Brethren of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> to be ſlain: And to ſtrengthen his Party,<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> joyns with <hi>Jehonadah</hi> the Son of <hi>Rechab,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, <hi>Ahab ſerved Baal a little, but Jehu ſhall ſerve him much:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> He appoints Sacrifices and ſolemn Aſſemblies, until he had gotten them under his Power, and then deſtroys them all. Was not he a ſenſual Man,<note place="margin">v. 25.</note> whoſe very Sword was drunk with ſuch Royal blood, and glutted with the Fleſh of Prieſts and Nobles, and all under a pretence of Zeal for the Lord? Yet this is the Character which the Scripture gives him, <hi>From the Sins of Jeroboam, the Son of Nebat,</hi>

                  <p>Though the Swine be an unclean Creature, and now and then wallows in the Mire, yet it only defiles it ſelf, and is ſoon ſurfeited with a few Acorns: But the ravenous Wolf, that knows how to put on Sheeps clothing, and hunts up and down, from one Flock to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and devours the Younglings, and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the Flock, and is nouriſhed by rapine and blood, and inceſſantly troubleth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the good Shepheard, is doubtleſs the moſt ſenſual and pernicious Beaſt.

In all Religions, the Multitude take up their Perſwaſions from the Country, and Parents, of whom they are born, and educated; and had the moſt of us been born, and inſtructed by <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> Parents, we had been of the ſame Religion, without doubting of, or inquiring into the grounds of it: and in all thoſe Religions, as we ſee alſo in our own, ſome Perſons are more diſpoſed, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their Bodies, to fervour and zeal in the Religion which they do profeſs,<note place="margin">Perit judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium cum res tranſit in affectum.</note> above others; or if they be not naturally inclined
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99423:59"/>to more devotion, yet being brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrict Diſcipline, and receiving early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, of fears and hopes, of great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and advantages in the mode of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which their Parents and Teachers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto them, they are ſo rooted in a good Opinion of their own, and ſo prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all others, that little leſs than a Miracle can remove them. We have an inſtance in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> bred up at <hi>the Feet of Gamaliel,</hi> and <hi>according to the strictest Sect of the Phariſees;</hi> his natural temper inclined him to a fervency and diligence in what he did, and accordingly <hi>he breathed out threatnings and ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Diſciples of the Lord:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 9.1.</note> He begged the employment,<note place="margin">Acts 26.9.</note> and <hi>haled Men and Women to Priſon;</hi> And in all this, he acted <hi>according to a good Conſcience,</hi> as he thought, until in a miraculous manner, it pleaſed God to ſhew him the error of his ways. Thus in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, where the people from their infancy, are perſwaded of the great Holineſs, Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and Power of the Pope, and are awed with the ſtory of Purgatory, and relieved again by cheap Pardons and Indulgences, and are alſo kept from the uſe of ſuch means, as might better inform them, they are not only ignorant of their own, but alſo ſo prejudiced againſt another Religion, never inquiring into the grounds of either, that it muſt be an act of more than ordinary grace, to convert ſuch Perſons. It is even ſo among us, where
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99423:60"/>there are ſeveral Modes of Worſhip, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only prejudices in our Parents, or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, againſt the publick Worſhip profeſſed among us, and ſuch Parents inform their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, of Profaneneſs in the generality of the People, of Superſtition in the adminiſtration of holy things, of Antichriſtianiſme in the Government, what good Men they are, that cannot in point of Conſcience conform to them, but chooſe rather to loſe all they have, how Devout they are in their Prayers, Powerful in their Preaching, Holy in their Lives; How hard a task is it to Undeceive ſuch People, who are verily perſwaded, that all that hath been told them is true, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never doubted, and inquired into the truth of them, have continued in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the one, and in Communion with the other, and (as they believe) are greatly edified in knowledge and grace, and as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> acting zealouſly according to his knowledge and Conſcience, before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, thought verily,<note place="margin">Acts 26.9.</note> that <hi>he ought to do all thoſe things againſt the Name of Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> and that he did God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in it. Now, what is the moſt probable means to convert ſuch a one? Should any of the Apoſtles have gone to <hi>Saul,</hi> and upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him with hypocriſie, and diſſimulation, <hi>Saul</hi> was guilty of no ſuch thing: he acted according to his knowledge and Conſcience, and ſuch a Method would have confirmed him
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99423:60"/>in his preſent perſwaſion, that he acted for, and they againſt the truth. The ſame Method therefore, that our Saviour uſed in <hi>Saul</hi>'s converſion, is the moſt probable for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving of ſuch prejudiced Perſons, To convince them, <hi>It is Jeſus whom they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,</hi> that the Phariſees, under whom they were educated, made Religion only a Cloak to hide their groſs impieties, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs about Ceremonies, and <hi>tithing Mint, Anniſe, and Cummin,</hi> was but a pretence to blind Men from charging them with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>weightier matters of the Law,</hi> and there needs no other help to diſcover falſe Teachers, than that of our Saviour; <hi>by their fruits ye ſhall know them:</hi> for as when we ſee a Wolf, though in Sheeps clothing, begin to ſcatter and worrey the Flock, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to be a Wolf; ſo when we ſee Men live in Envy and Malice, and to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Confuſion, and every Evil thing, we may conclude they have not the Spirit which they pretend to. And as for the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>Christ</hi> inſtructs them in plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Precepts of Repentance, faith, and new obedience, and vindicates the Law of God, from the groſs and falſe interpretations of the Phariſees, who, notwithſtanding the good Opinion that the People had of them, were indeed grand Hypocrites, proud, cenſorious, malicious: And therefore they ought to ſhake off that heavy Yoke, that was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99423:61"/>upon their Conſciences, and to be of a meek and teachable Spirit, to <hi>ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and conſider what was written in the Law and the Prophets, of <hi>doing juſtly, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy,</hi>

We read in the 2d. of <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. how <hi>Abſalom</hi> under pretence of a Vow, and with fair ſpeeches, ſtole the hearts of the People, and led them into Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99423:62"/>foment Diſcord and Separation, which (St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, as well as our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) will bring in <hi>confuſion, and every evil thing,</hi> are Separatiſts in the higheſt degree. Beſides, the generality of the People, who are now ſeparated, were reconciled to the Communion of our Church, which was done, either upon good information and ſound knowledge of the lawfulneſs of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with us, or in a way of diſſimulation and hypocriſie: If upon the account of a right information, then they ſin in the Separation, that is now made; If upon the conſideration of other vile ends, and ſecular motives, they were hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in ſo doing, and ſuch in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they continue ſtill. It was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly their duty before they departed, to have conſulted with thoſe ſpiritual Guides, under whoſe Miniſtry they were, for the reſolution of their doubts, and trial of the Grounds of their intended Separation, which being wholly neglected, it argues, at leaſt, great raſhneſs, and ſupine negligence, and conſequently that Senſuality, and not Piety, was the ground of their Separation.</p>
                  <p>And as the Religion of ſome Men, is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to their Natural conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and continual education; ſo bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and accidental infirmities and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, have a great influence to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of others. Thus a diſcontented
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99423:62"/>ſpirit, diſappointment of hopes, decay of Trade, a Sedentary calling, and labouring in the Fire, may raiſe ſuch melancholy fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſo ſtrongly imprint them on the Spirits of Men, as to make them really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve abſurd and impoſſible things, as if they were real truths: for <hi>Melancholy</hi> is of the nature of Wine; if ſends up hot and flatulent Vapours into the Brain, and there creates ſtrange Imaginations, and inableth Men with confident and eloquent Language, to expreſs their fancies; and this temper, as it diſpoſeth Men moſtly to tamper with matters of Religion, ſo the vehemence wherewith they are acted, makes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves (as hath been commonly ſuppoſed of eminent Poets and Orators, and as the <hi>Turks</hi> at this day do think of diſtracted Men) to be <hi>inspired.</hi> Some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, overcome with the paſſion of <hi>jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> do believe and act, as if all their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and ſuſpicions were true, and will not be convinced by the moſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments to the contrary. So in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Diſtempers, as many have thought themſelves Kings and Emperors, ſo others have fancied themſelves great Prophets, ſent from God to reform the World, and they declaim againſt the Corruptions of the Churches, and contrive new Models for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of all that they fancy amiſs: For, though <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſome other Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99423:63"/>were meer Impoſtors, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſpirations meerly upon deſign; yet doubtleſs others, who have imagined very ſtrange things (as that they were the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> ſent from God, that they were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit of God, or at leaſt had that Spirit dwelling perſonally in them) have been fully perſwaded that theſe apprehenſions were true, and have both acted and ſuffered, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and dyed in the atteſtation of them. As that Learned Doctor of Divinity,<note place="margin">Franciſ. de la Cruz. Acoſta de Noviſſ. Temporibus l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99423:63"/>to efficacy. That GOD had offered him Hypoſtatical Union; and an Hundred ſuch Vagaries, he firmly held; and yet this Man (our Author ſays) was as perfect in his Senſes, as to ſoundneſs of Brain, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he wrote of him; wherefore the Biſhop of <hi>Quinto,</hi> with <hi>Acosta,</hi> and other Divines, were appointed to diſpute with him, concerning his Opinions. Who began to alledge, that his Doctrine being above Humane Reaſon, could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but by Scripture, and Miracles. As for Scripture, I have proved it (ſaith he) by more clear and pregnant Teſtimonies, than thoſe, by which ever <hi>Paul</hi> did prove Jeſus the true Meſſias. As for <hi>Miracles,</hi> he had done ſome ſo great, (as he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) that the Reſurrection of Chriſt was not greater, in as much as he had been verily, and truly dead, and was raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And in the Conference for two days time, though he had not had any Book in the Priſon, where he was five Years, his very Breviary being taken from him, yet did he quote places of Scripture out of the Prophets, the Pſalms, Apocalypſe, and other Books, ſo many and ſo long, that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Memory cauſed Admiration: As for Miracles, he told them (as by <hi>Prophecie</hi>) that <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> was vanquiſhed by the <hi>Turks:</hi> That <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> had loſt moſt part of his Kingdome: That Pope

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> was depoſed by a Council, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to be choſen at <hi>Rome;</hi> all which he affirmed, not onely to be true, but to be known to them to be ſo, though indeed they knew them all to be falſe. And when for theſe things, he was condemned to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and led out as a publick Spectacle, he ceaſed not to look up to Heaven, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it ſeems the Devil had promiſed him) that <hi>fire would come from thence</hi> to conſume his Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>From this Hiſtory we may argue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning imaginations and perſwaſions leſs wild and ſtrange, and yet ſuch as we know to be truly and really believed by them upon whom they are wrought; and I need not inſtance in the Paroxyſmes and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Enthuſiaſts, and <hi>Quakers,</hi> whether proceeding from Melancholy Diſtempers, (which may go very far) or from Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſuggeſtions, who are yet ſo confident of the truth and Divinity of them, as that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them would dye for that belief, but in the confidence of other more ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who believe themſelves the Elect Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and to be as well aſſured of their Salvation, as if they had read their Names written in the Book of Life, who yet live in ſuch manifeſt contradiction to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, in Envy, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Malice, Diſobedience, Lying, Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are Implacable, Unnatural, Unholy,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99423:64"/>that if the Scriptures be true, their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions muſt needs be falſe.</p>
                  <p>The miſcarriages of ſuch as have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to extraordinary impulſes of the Spirit, have been ſo notoriouſly impious, that it is eaſie to fill a Volume with ſuch Relations; I ſhall only give an inſtance or two, in our own Countrey. And whereas it hath been pleaded to the prejudice of the Magiſtrates, who have exemplarily puniſhed ſuch Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, that they were diſtracted Perſons, and therefore deſerved pity, rather than ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penalties; I do confeſs, that in ſome of them, as it is ſaid of <hi>Swinckfield,</hi> there wanted <hi>Caput regulatum,</hi> a ſtaid Head, but in the moſt there was wanting <hi>Cor bonum,</hi> a good Heart, and a humble Spirit: As in <hi>Coppinger,</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> who came into <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and getting up into a Cart, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, that they had News from Heaven, which was, That <hi>Hacket</hi> their Prophet did repreſent <hi>Christ,</hi> and was partaker of his glorious Body, in his principal Spirit; and that <hi>they two</hi> were his <hi>Prophets,</hi> the one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> the other of <hi>Judgment,</hi> being call'd and ſent of God, to aſſiſt him in his great work; when they were apprehended, and examined by Perſons of Honor, and of great Learning, they gave ready and pertinent anſwers to every queſtion, upon which they were examined; by which it appear'd, they were under no other diſtraction, than what
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99423:65"/>a violent Proſecution of the Diſcipline, which they contended for, had betrayed them into. About the ſame time, one <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bourchet</hi> was poſſeſt with an Opinion, that it was lawful to ſlay any, that did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Evangelical truth, (as he called his own fancy) and becauſe Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> one of the Privy Council, was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Adverſary thereunto, he reſolved to murther him, but by a miſtake, meeting with the famous Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> he ſtruck at him, for which he was committed to the Tower, and being there, finds an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, with a Fire-brand taken from the Hearth, to knock out the Brains of one of his Keepers, for which being condemned of Murther, he had his right Hand cut off, and dyed on the Gallows, in a ſullen and ſilent humor.

                  <p>You ſee then, that there were juſt and neceſſary cauſes, of making ſevere Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch practices, and by an Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> for reſtraining the Queen's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Subjects in obedience, it was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, under the Penalty of Baniſhment, that any Perſon ſhould be preſent at, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to thoſe unlawful Meetings or Conventicles.

Mortifie therefore theſe and all other fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts: ſtudy Chriſt and him crucified, that you may,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9, 10.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>know him and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his ſufferings, being made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his death.</hi> No ſuch charm againſt Separation as a true mortification of fleſhly luſts and deſires. Study therefore to exceed others in Humility and Charity, <hi>in a meek and quiet spirit, which in the ſight of God, is of more eſteem,</hi> than all thoſe furious Zealots, that <hi>know not what spirit they are of.</hi> And in the words of St. <hi>Jude, build up your ſelves on your moſt holy faith;</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt dying for your ſins, and riſing for your Juſtification, and ſtill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Interceſſion for you: In his Name pray unto God, with ſuch fervour and hope, faith, humility, and perſeverance, that you may be kept in the love of GOD, and a comfortable expectation of the mercy of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99423:69"/>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>The wifeſt and beſt of us are but Men, compaſſed about with many infirmities, what through ignorance and intereſt, paſſion and prejudice, in many things we offend all; and all the means and diligence we can uſe, without the ſpecial grace of God, will be too little to undeceive us, and ſet us in the right way, which grace he hath promiſed only to the humble and meek:<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.9.</note> 
                     <hi>The meek he will guide in judgment, and the meek he will teach his way.</hi> 'Tis the firſt Leſſon that Chriſt teacheth his Diſciples, and that by his Example, as well as Precept; <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.29</note> 
                     <hi>and ye ſhall find rest unto your Souls.</hi> I conclude with thoſe Pathetical perſwaſions of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which I beſeech God to imprint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our hearts: <hi>If there be any conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Christ, if any comfort of love,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind; Let nothing be done through strife and vain glory, but in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, let each eſteem other better than themſelves.</hi> And again, <hi>Put on,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>as the Elect of God, holy and beloved bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99423:70"/>you, ſo alſo do ye;</hi> And, <hi>above all things put on Charity, which is the bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo ye are called in one body, and be ye thankful.</hi>

                  <p>SInce this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Schiſm</hi> was in the <hi>Preſs,</hi> I met with a Book of <hi>Miſcellanies</hi> under Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Name, in which was a TRACT concerning <hi>Schiſme,</hi> much applauded by the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts,</hi> both <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 191.</note> to be (as he calls them) but two <hi>Theological Scarcrows:</hi> but upon my firſt reading it, I apprehended it to be ſo far from being unanſwerable, that it did ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confute it ſelf, which I doubt not will appear to all judicious <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> upon this <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the TRACT, which followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> WHat is the benefit of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Communion is the ſtrength and ground of all ſociety, Sacred and Civil: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore cauſeth a breach, if in civil oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, is guilty of Sedition, or Rebellion; if in Eccleſiaſtical differences, is guilty of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99423:71"/>Schiſm; ſo that Schiſm is an Eccleſiaſtical Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Sedition is a Lay-ſchiſme, <hi>p.</hi> 193.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the definition of Schiſme?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Schiſme is an unneceſſary ſeparation of Chriſtians,<note place="margin">p. 195.</note> from that part of the viſible Church of which they were once Members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> When is Separation neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Separation is then neceſſary, when nothing will ſave us from the guilt of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but open ſeparation, <hi>p.</hi> 195.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> When is Schiſme complete?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe two things make Schiſm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The choice of a Biſhop in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former. <hi>2ly,</hi> The erecting a new Church and Oratory,<note place="margin">p. 196.</note> for the dividing Party to meet in publickly. As in the late famous controverſie in <hi>Holland, de Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione,</hi> as long as the diſagreeing Parties went no further than diſputes, the Schiſme was unhatched; but as ſoon as one Party ſwept an old Cloyſter, and by a pretty Art ſuddenly made it a Church (by putting a new Pulpit in it) for the ſeparating Party to meet in, what before was a Controverſie became a formal Schiſme, <hi>p.</hi> 197.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the danger of Schiſme?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What the Ancients ſpake by way of cenſure of Schiſme in general, is moſt true, (and they ſpake moſt ſtrange things of it) for they ſaw,<note place="margin">p. 198.</note> that unadviſedly, and upon fancy, to break the knot of union betwixt man and man (eſpecially among Chriſtians, upon whom the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99423:71"/>tye of love and communion doth eſpecially reſt) was a crime <hi>hardly pardonable,</hi> and that nothing abſolves a Man from the guilt of it, but true and unpretended Conſcience. And <hi>p.</hi> 192. Hereſie and Schiſme are things of great moment, the one offending againſt Truth, the other againſt Charity, and both are deadly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Was the Schiſme of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> any way excuſable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, they were compleat Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, upon the grounds before mentioned,<note place="margin">p. 196.</note> nor was there any neceſſary cauſe for their Separation, for the occaſion of the Schiſme was an Opinion, that where good and bad were mixed, there could be no Church,<note place="margin">p. 205.</note> by reaſon of pollution evaporating (as it were) from ſinners, which blaſted the righteous, and made all unciean, whereas in his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he pretended that wicked perſons found no ſhelter, <hi>p.</hi> 206.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How was this Schiſme of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> refuted?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this one maxime of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (which was irrefragably aſſerted) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitatem Eccleſiae per totum orbem diſperſae propter non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullorum peccata non eſſe deſerendam,</hi> That the unity of the Catholick Church is not to be forſaken, for the ſins of ſome that are within it, <hi>p.</hi> 206.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Though in this Schiſme the <hi>Donatist</hi> was the Schiſmatick,<note place="margin">p. 208.</note> yet might not any one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99423:72"/>communicate with them, if occaſion ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? if ſo be they did not flatter them in their Schiſme; for why might it not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to go to Church with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

You may not communicate with ſuch, becauſe of the danger of Schiſme before mentioned. <hi>2ly,</hi> Becauſe it is not lawful, no not for prayer, hearing, conference, or any other religious office whatſoever, for People to Aſſemble, otherwiſe than by publick order is allowed; for, why ſhould Men deſire to do that ſuſpiciouſly, in private, which may be performed warrantably in publick? <hi>p.</hi> 229, 230.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what if they to whoſe care the execution of the publick ſervice is committed, do ſome things unſeemly, ſuſpicious, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?<note place="margin">p. 209.</note> if their Garments be cenſured, as, or indeed be ſuperſtitious? what if the Geſture of Adoration be uſed at the Altar? what if the Homiliſt or Preacher deliver any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of the truth of which we are not well perſwaded?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet for all this, we may not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99423:72"/>except we be conſtrained to bear a part in them our ſelves:<note place="margin">p. 210.</note> The Prieſts under <hi>Eli</hi> had ſo ill demeaned themſelves about the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that they made it to ſtink, yet the People refuſed not to come to the Tabernacle, nor to bring their Sacrifices to the Prieſts; for in Schiſmes which concern fact, nothing can be a juſt cauſe of refuſal of Communion, but only the requiring of the execution of ſome unlawful or ſuſpected Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What may we do when ſome Perſons in a Church teach erroneous Doctrines,<note place="margin">p. 214.</note> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> concerning the Trinity, or the Perſon of our Saviour?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What to do in this caſe is not a point of any great depth of underſtanding to diſcover,<note place="margin">p. 215.</note> ſo be it diſtemper and partiality do not intervene. I do not ſee, that <hi>Opinionum varietas &amp; Opinantium unitas,</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is your Opinion of Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It evidently appears that all Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon unneceſſary occaſions of Separation, are to be ſo ſtiled;<note place="margin">p. 227.</note> ſo that in this ſenſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is, and that perchance, not without good reaſon; For <hi>firſt,</hi> it hath been at all times confeſſed neceſſary, that God ſhould have,<note place="margin">p. 227.</note> not only inward and private devotion, when Men either in their Hearts, or Cloſets, or within their private Walls, pray, praiſe, confeſs, and acknowledge; but that all theſe things ſhould be done in publick, by troops and ſhoals of Men, from whence proceeded publick Temples, Altars, forms of Service, appointed Times, and the like, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for open Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What is the reaſon of the ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Laws againſt private Meetings?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Take heed of entertaining ſcruples of Conſcience, about things of little moment, for when ſcruples of Conſcience began to be made, or pretended, then Schiſmes began to break in, <hi>p.</hi> 217.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That you do not endeavour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance one Biſhop againſt another, (much more a Presbyter againſt the Biſhop) which in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s language,<note place="margin">p. 222.</note> is <hi>Erigere Altare contra Altare,</hi> to ſet up Altar againſt Altar, to which he imputeth the Original of all Church diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and if you read him, you would think he thought no other Church-tumult to be a

                  <p>IT is granted by all ſober Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that the Church hath po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of making Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, for Decency and Order in the publick worſhip of God; and not only to preſcribe the neceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place; but alſo to continue and eſtabliſh thoſe ancient rites of the Chriſtian Church, which were practiſed in the primitive times, and are in themſelves of an indifferent nature; which authority of the Church was aſſerted in the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> confeſſion, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>

                        <hi>Tayler,</hi> and moſt brave <hi>Bradford,</hi> with the cloud of Witneſſes that ſerved God by the Liturgy to their laſt breath, even in their moſt perſonal and dying devotions, and ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for ſo doing, having the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt them by their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and alſo preſſed the people, and their choiceſt friends, to adhere to it, and ſerve God by it. And however ſome ſucceeding Chriſtians have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome reformation of the Liturgy, they have conſtantly, and with due devotion ſerved God in the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and defended the ſame againſt the <hi>cenſorious Browniſts,</hi> and rigid <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts.</hi>
                     </q> — And the firſt reformation had the perfection of ſubſtance, though not of degrees, Gods true worſhip was reſtored to a right order of miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Ordinances of God did then truly exiſt, as to their ſubſtance, and ſalvably as to their Miniſterial mode towards the people; otherwiſe thoſe holy Men had not wherein to rejoyce before God and the World. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they did not entayl a Popiſh, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, or Idolatrous Yoke (as ſome call the Ceremonies) on the
<pb facs="tcp:99423:79"/>Church of God. Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> was one of the firſt Oppoſers of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and inſtead of acquainting you with the Anſwers of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> to his arguments, it will be ſufficient to ſay, that Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> himſelf hath ſaid enough to confure the diſſenters of our times, for firſt he oppoſed them, only as inconvenient, not unlawful: and perſwaded Miniſters rather to wear the Garments than ceaſe their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,<note place="margin">2d.

                     </note> and in his <hi>Evangelical Harmony,</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 22. (<hi>à</hi> v. 14. <hi>ad</hi> 19.) he ſaith, that kneeling in the receiving of the Sacrament being incommodious in its own nature, and made more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſtition,<note place="margin">p. <hi>877.</hi> Edit. ult.</note> is not ſo to be rejected, that for the ſake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſhould abſtain from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the thing is not in its own nature unlawful — And what his judgment was in the caſe of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, appears in a Letter of his to Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> lately publiſhed: And in another Letter to his Siſter <hi>Anne Stubs,</hi> reproving her for ſtumbling at this ſtone, that becauſe of ſome defects in a Church, inſtead of concluding that
<pb facs="tcp:99423:79"/>Church to be imperfect, ſhe concluded it to be no Church. The wiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Hilderſham, Bradſhaw, Paget, Ball, Gifford,</hi> and other learned Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts of old did foreſee and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear this Spirit (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>

                     </note>) But this Spirit being very troubleſome and pragmatical, the moſt learned of the diſſenters did alway endeavour to moderate it, as well by their quiet and peaceable practice, as by their learned and earneſt arguments, and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to unity in the publick Worſhip. And accordingly when King <hi>James,</hi> ſhortly after his entry into the Throne, had appointed the conference at <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> Court, where Doctor <hi>Raynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spark,</hi> and others were appointed to diſcourſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in controverſie, with ſome <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Divines:</hi> They were ſo far from affirming the ceremonies to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they would not have it known that any of that party were ſo weak, as to affirm it; and Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> was ſo far ſatisfied, that before his death he ſolemnly declared himſelf to be of the communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and deſired abſolution according to the
<pb facs="tcp:99423:80"/>form appointed in the Liturgy. About this time Biſhop <hi>Morton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sprint,</hi> and others did moſt rationally, and irrefragably aſſert the innocency of the Ceremonies, and the neceſſity of the Miniſters conforming rather than to ſuffer deprivation, and of the peoples, rather than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Ordinances of Chriſt. I intend not a Hiſtory of the tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this buſineſs, and therefore ſhall only give you a brief account of it, from the beginning of our unhappy troubles. The <hi>Long Parliament</hi> in their Petition, and <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> joyned with it, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 15. 1642. inform us of ſome Malignant parties, whoſe proceedings evidently appeared to be, mainly, for the advantage and increaſe of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and were compoſed, ſet up, and acted, by the ſubtle practice of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other Engineers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for <hi>Rome,</hi> who had ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, as to corrupt divers of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and others, in prime places of the Church, and <hi>p.</hi> 20. they intimate, that Idolatry,<note place="margin">Exact Collect.</note> and Popiſh Ceremonies were introduced to the Church, by command of the Biſhops; and the
<pb facs="tcp:99423:80"/>people were not only debarred the Church, but expelled the Kingdom. And that thoſe were counted fitteſt for Eccleſiaſtical preferment, and ſooneſt attained it, who were moſt officious in promoting Superſtition, moſt viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in railing againſt Godlineſs and honeſty. We deſire (ſay they) to unburthen the Conſciences of men, of needleſs and Superſtitious Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſuppreſs Innovations, and take away the monuments of Idolatry. To this His Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory anſwered thus. <q rend="margQuotes">The fears for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may haply be, not only as it may be innovated by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> party, but as it is accompanied with ſome Ceremonies, at which ſome tender Conſciences really are, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ſcandalized. Concerning Religion, as there may be any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of favour, or inclination to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> we are willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to all the World, that as we have been from our childhood brought up in, and practiſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion now eſtabliſhed, ſo it is well known, we have (not contented ſimply with the principles of our
<pb facs="tcp:99423:81"/>Education) given a good proportion of our time and pains, to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the grounds of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it is different from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are from our Soul ſo fully ſatisfied, and aſſured that it is the moſt pure, and agreeable to the Sacred Word of God, of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion now practiſed in the Chriſtian world, that as we believe we can maintain the ſame by unanſwerable Reaſons, ſo we hope we ſhould readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeal to it by the effuſion of our Bloud, if it pleaſed God to call us to that Sacrifice. And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſo acceptable to us, as any propoſition which may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the advancement of it here, or the propagation of it abroad, being the only means of drawing down the Bleſſings of God upon our ſelves and this Nation. And we have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unfortunate if this Profeſſion of ours be wanting to our people— For differences among our ſelves, for matters indifferent in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we ſhall, in tenderneſs to any number of our loving Subjects, very willingly comply with the advice of
<pb facs="tcp:99423:81"/>our Parliament, that ſome Law may be made, for the exemption of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences from puniſhment, or perſecution, for ſuch Ceremonies, and in ſuch caſes, which by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt men are held to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters indifferent, and of ſome to be abſolutely unlawful. (Provided <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before mentioned, under the three cautions.) To that clauſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns corruptions (as you ſtile them) in Religion, in Church Government, and in Diſcipline, and the removing ſuch unneceſſary Ceremonies, as weak Conſciences might check at: That for any illegal Innovations which may have crept in, we ſhall willingly concur in the removal of them, but we are very ſorry to hear in ſuch general terms, corruption in Religion objected, ſince we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in Conſcience, that no Church on Earth can be found, that profeſſeth the true Religion with more purity of Doctrine, than the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth, nor where the Government and Diſcipline are joyntly more beautified and free from Superſtition, than as they are
<pb facs="tcp:99423:82"/>here eſtabliſhed by Law, which by the Grace of God we will with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy maintain, while we live, in their purity and glory, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all invaſions of <hi>Popery,</hi> but alſo from the irreverence of thoſe Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Separatiſts, wherewith of late this Kingdom and City abound, to the great diſhonour and hazard of Church and State.</q> Doubtleſs they had very much of the nature of the <hi>Adder</hi> in them, who inſtead of being charmed into a quiet and meek ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by theſe moſt pious, gracious, ſincere Reaſons and condeſcenſions, did precipitate themſelves, and the three Nations to thoſe horrible confuſions, which that Prophetick, as well as Royal Spirit foretold, for immediately after, the people of the Land being frighted by frequent remonſtrances of fears and jealouſies of Popery and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, run themſelves into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſnares as to their Eſtates, by the inſatiable oppreſſion of their new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and their Lives, by their want of Loyalty, and as to their Conſciences by illegal Oaths and Covenants, till the beauty of Religion was deſtroyed
<pb facs="tcp:99423:82"/>for want of Order and Reverence, and the ſubſtance of it devoured by Sects and Hereſies of all kinds. And this moſtly for Reformation of Ceremonies, for the Doctrine needed it not. I do even tremble to relate in a corner, what a Preacher who was then of great repute, ſpake in the moſt eminent meeting of the Nation (the preſent Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1656.) in theſe words. Worthy Patriots, you that are Rulers, in this preſent Parliament— Praiſed be God, who hath delivered us from Prelatical innovations, Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genu-flexions and cringings, with croſſings, and all that Popiſh traſh, and trumpery; and truly, I ſpeak no more, than what I have often thought, and ſaid—The removal of theſe inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burdens, countervails for the Bloud and Treaſure ſhed and ſpent in theſe late diſtractions; nor did I as yet ever hear of any godly men, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired (were it poſſible) to purchaſe their friends, or mony again, at ſo dear a rate, as the return of theſe, to have thoſe Soul-burthening Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian yokes impoſed upon us; if any ſuch here be, I am ſure, that deſire is
<pb facs="tcp:99423:83"/>no part of their godlineſs, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf in that, to be none of the number.] Can any that bears the name of a Chriſtian hear ſuch things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror, eſpecially when he ſhall ſeriouſly conſider what a deluge of bloud had overflown the land, The King being Murthered about Eight years before, and the Sword, and the Axe having glutted themſelves with the Bloud of many Noble Heroes, and learned Clergy-men? And beſides the many thouſands that dyed for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Loyalty, there were very many that periſhed alſo in Rebellion, againſt God and the King. He had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle charity for his Brethren, that would not on ſuch eaſie conditions, redeem them from the grave and hell; if we may argue from a Parable, <hi>Dives</hi> had more charity in that place of Torment, than was in this Preachers breaſt, and if this be a mark of godlineſs, <hi>Satan</hi> needs not to be transformed, to paſs for an Angel of light, ſure I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more oppoſite to this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical truth, which the Text that is before us commends, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring mercy before Sacrifice. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb facs="tcp:99423:83"/>it therefore to your ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether thoſe perſons, who ſo pertinaciouſly inſiſt upon the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of our Ceremonies, as to increaſe our diviſions, and engage us again in Bloud and confuſion, are not acted by a like Spirit of perverſeneſs, that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf to live in the fire of contention takes pleaſure in drawing others and tormenting them in the like flames.</p>
                  <p>At the happy return of our Dear Soveraign, who after the example of his Martyred Father, was careful to ſee the Church eſtabliſhed in its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we found this evil Spirit ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to oppoſe as if it had taken ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſe than it ſelf, to ſecure the poſſeſſion which it had in the hearts of the people, being in danger of being caſt out: then was <hi>Nehuſtan</hi> ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to perſwade the people, that the <hi>Liturgy, Ceremonies, and other things uſed in the Church of England, ought not to be impoſed, nor retained, but utterly extirpated, and laid aſide, and that every one in his place ought to do his part to the aboliſhing of it, and not ſit ſtill in the midſt of ſuch defilements and ſnares, but diſcover their hatred of them, decline
<pb facs="tcp:99423:84"/>their uſe, and endeavour the rooting of them out;</hi> and all upon this ground, that things which have been abuſed in falſe Worſhip muſt be laid aſide.<note place="margin">Gilaſpy.</note> Then comes another <hi>Boreas</hi> from the <hi>North</hi> (whence moſt of our evils came) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Diſpute againſt the <hi>Engliſh Popiſh Ceremonies,</hi> which he explains to be, a contending for the purity of Chriſt, againſt the corruptions of Anti-chriſt, and this Spirit, as if he were indeed of the triumphant party, leads in chains no meaner perſons, than <hi>Hooker, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Burges, Sprint, Paybody, Andrews, Saravia, Tilen, Spotſwood, Lindſey, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> &amp;c. who were all particularly confuted, and vanquiſhed by him, as he boaſted. But this pitiful man dealt very mercifully with them, for their chains were ſuch as fell off of their own accord: and ſo do thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous appellations which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to fix on the Church, and her practiſes, calling them Popiſh, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, Idle and Idolized,<note place="margin">Prefaco, p. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> for thus he beſpeaks the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Oh thou faireſt among Women, what haſt thou to do with the inveag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling appurtenances and habiliments
<pb facs="tcp:99423:84"/>of <hi>Babylon</hi> the whore <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as impotent as his Obloquy, the naming of which is confutation enough, at leaſt, if the Reader will but turn his negatives into affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and his affirmatives into nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the weakneſs of the man, and his manner of arguing will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all.</p>
                  <p>As Firſt, when he ſays we are not to account the Ceremonies matters of ſmall importance] contrary to the ſenſe of ours, and all the Reformed Churches which account them things indifferent and not worth the contending for. Secondly, Let not (ſays he) the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of peace and unity cool your fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or make you ſpare to oppoſe your ſelves to thoſe idle and Idolized Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies] contrary to the Text, and to <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. Thirdly, beware alſo you be not deceived with a pretence of the Churches conſent, and of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as well with the ancient Church as with the now Reformed Churches in the forms and cuſtoms of both] as if the conſent of the Ancient Church before Popery, and all the Reformed ſince, were one of the ſnares to be
<pb facs="tcp:99423:85"/>avoided. Fourthly, moreover, becauſe the foredeck and hindeck of all our oppoſites probations, do reſolve and reſt finally into the authority of a law— therefore we certiorate you with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> that <hi>Si acquieviſtis imperio, peſſimo laqueo vos induiſtis</hi>] as if there were no difference between the eſtabliſhing of iniquity by a Law (of which <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſpeaks) and the laws of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors for— decency and order. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, do not reckon it enough to bear within the incloſure of your ſecret thoughts, a certain diſlike of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and other abuſes now ſet on foot;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Contrary to S.</hi> Paul, Ro. 14.22</note> except by profeſſion and action you evidence the ſame, and ſo ſhew your Faith by your fact: principally prayers and ſupplications are the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Spiritual warfare, but as they ought to be done, ſo the atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other ſecundary means, ought not to be left undone. Theſe are the chief of his arguments, which he ſums up in the Epiſtle dedicated to all and every one in the Reformed Churches of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and you may judge by theſe, of the validity of the whole Book which
<pb facs="tcp:99423:85"/>conſiſts of 336. pages, wherein is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing objected, or aſſerted, but what hath been abundantly confuted by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſons and arguments. After this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Pipe march many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formado's headed by Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> whoſe chief objection is, that the ceremonies are unwritten and unſcriptural inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men,<note place="margin">Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal love. p. <hi>212.</hi>
                     </note> and that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and authority muſt be ſhewn, for what is impoſed in the worſhip of God. The ridiculouſneſs of this objection hath been clearly demonſtrated by the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and others. Then Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> ſends forth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, and his <hi>Bonaſus Vapulans,</hi> who inveighs againſt the ceremonies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for being ſignificant, and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the ſign of the Croſs, which is made a ſign of dedication to God, in Token that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas others of his party do oppoſe them, becauſe they are not ſignificative enough.</p>
                  <p>To him ſucceeds the Author of the <hi>Reherſal,</hi> who ſays that the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts defining a Sacrament to be an outward and viſible ſign of an inward and ſpiritual grace (Omitting the chief part of the definition [<hi>viz.</hi> ordained
<pb facs="tcp:99423:86"/>by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf]) do make the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a Sacramental nature. To theſe the learned <hi>Ritchel</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Ceremoniis,</hi> gives ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all unprejudiced Readers, and <hi>Durel, Parker</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have done the ſame. 41.61. p. 90, 454.</note>, and others have done no leſs. It will be but labour in vain, to repeat here all the ſolid replies to thoſe empty objections. One ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Scripture, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our urgeth in the Text, againſt thoſe that on pretence of contending for their own, againſt the eſtabliſhed rites and cuſtomes of the Church, do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the laws of Obedience, Love, and Peace, will ſilence them all, if they be not poſſeſt with a ſpirit of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For if we ſhould ſuppoſe that the rites and ceremonies were as expreſly ſet down in the Goſpel to be uſed, or for born in the publick worſhip of God, as the rites and circumſtances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices, were in the ceremonial law: yet as the Sacrifices themſelves, much more the modes of preparing and offering them, might be uſed or omitted, for the performance of moral duties; ſo doubtleſs, if things of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ceremonial nature, had been
<pb facs="tcp:99423:86"/>commanded, or forbidden in expreſs terms, they might yet be obſerved, or omitted, as the ſubſtantial ſervice of God, and obedience to his greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, for charity and peace might be beſt performed. But theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not determined particularly by the Goſpel, but left under general rules, for decency and order, may doubtleſs be determined by a lawful authority, ſuch as that of our Church, under our Gracious Soveraign, is, and being ſo determined and impoſed, there is an advantage on the ſide of Authority, againſt a ſcrupulous conſcience, which ought to over-rule the practice of ſuch who are members of that Church. It remains only that I endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move an objection or two againſt what is here ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the ceremonies be things of ſuch indifferency, Why do not they who are in authority, diſpenſe with the uſe of them, or totally lay them aſide for the ſake of peace and unity?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Magiſtrate doth but his duty in providing for the ſolemnity of Divine worſhip, according to thoſe general rules for decency and order
<pb facs="tcp:99423:87"/>preſcribed by the Apoſtles. <hi>2ly,</hi> What the Magiſtrate doth, is not only agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his private diſcretion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (for he practiſeth the ſame things that he preſcribes) but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deliberate determinations of the moſt wiſe and pious perſons of the Nation, in their ſolemn Aſſemblies, and doubtleſs (as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wrote to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) if they had known any thing better, they would have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that. <hi>3ly,</hi> It will very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the authority and reputation of Magiſtrates, ſo to comply with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune clamours of ſcrupulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as to alter or abrogate their laws and conſtitutions, as oft as diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſeduced perſons ſhall demand it. And though it be very uncertain that the craving party will be ſatisfied, when they are indulged in all that they deſire, yet it is certain that others will be incouraged to make new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and ſo create perpetual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances. And the gratifying of a few weaklings, or male-contents, may give juſt cauſe of offence, to a greater and better party, who are deſirous to worſhip God in the beauty of holineſs,
<pb facs="tcp:99423:87"/>and are really grieved at the irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and diſorders which are, and have been too obſervable in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of diſſenting parties. <hi>4ly,</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Magiſtrate ſhould tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs himſelf guilty of all thoſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have been charged upon him, and his predeceſſors, of impoſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, ſuperſtitious and <hi>Popiſh</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and perſecuting the godly and conſcientious people, that could not conform to them. And <hi>5ly,</hi> It would greatly defame thoſe worthy Martyrs, who not only thought fit to retain them, and gave cogent arguments for the lawful uſe of them, but ſealed the eſtabliſhed worſhip and diſcipline with their bloud, not only in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, but under the late Uſurpation alſo. <hi>6ly,</hi> It is an unreaſonable thing, to demand that, which they themſelves would deny, if they were in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates place; for let me ask them, whether they, being well perſwaded of their diſcipline and order (<hi>viz.</hi> that it is agreeable to the Word of God, to antiquity and reaſon) would comply with the deſires of diſſenting parties, to make ſuch alterations, as ſhould from
<pb facs="tcp:99423:88"/>time to time be required by others, contrary to their own judgments and conſciences? and to this we need no other anſwer, than the practice of the Objectors, when they were in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And who can doubt, but that they, who being ſubjects, do aſſume to themſelves a power of directing and preſcribing to the Magiſtrate, if they were in the Magiſtrates place would take it very ill to be directed by their Subjects. <hi>7ly,</hi> If the eſtabliſhed cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were removed, others of a like nature would ſucceed, as unſcriptural, and ſymbolical as they, (ſuch as ſitting at the Sacrament, and lifting up the hands to Heaven,) it being impoſſible almoſt to perform divine ſervice, with any decency, without ſuch: and ſeeing that for many centuries of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, wherein other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been complained of by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others, no man ever objected againſt the ceremonies which are uſed in our Church, and which were by thoſe famous Reformers and Martyrs retained in our Liturgy, it is no argument of a meek or quiet ſpirit, to make objections, and cauſe diviſions
<pb facs="tcp:99423:88"/>upon pretence of Superſtition in the Liturgy and ceremonies, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Church to ſalve their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſhould betray her own, and by abrogating her ſanctions, give the world more reaſon than yet hath been given, to believe, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> even from the firſt Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath been in a dangerous error, and the Factions that oppoſed her, have had truth and juſtice on their ſide.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Objection, Papiſts and Sectaries joyntly ſay, That other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters may as well juſtifie their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from us, on pretence of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies retained by our Church, as we can juſtifie our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by reaſon of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies injoyned by her. To which I ſhall not need to make any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than a ſhort appeal to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all unprejudiced perſons, Whether the Church of <hi>England,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the uſe of three Ceremonies declared by her ſelf to be indifferent, and acknowledged by her enemies not to be unlawful, can be thought by any ſober perſon to give as great, and juſt a cauſe of Separation from her, as all
<pb facs="tcp:99423:89"/>that load of Superſtition in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in his days, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> yoke was leſs heavy. To require Prayers in an unknown Tongue, and to Saints and Angels is doubtleſs more offenſive, than to uſe a ſolemn plain form of words, taken either from the Scripture, or the ancient Liturgies of the Church. What is the Surplice, Croſs in Baptiſm, and kneeling at the Sacrament for devotion, if compared to their Adoration of the tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated Hoſt, worſhipping of Images, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, their doctrines of the Popes Supremacy, and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of Purgatory and Indulgences, beſides the innumerable ceremonies daily practiſed by them? And as the Sectaries will not condemn the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for receding from theſe extreams, ſo neither can the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> blame her for want of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in retaining both purity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and decency of Worſhip, and abhorring thoſe other extreams of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge and profanation of holy things, of Rebellion and Bloud ſhed, though under pretence of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="tcp:99423:89"/>with both they and the Sectaries have defiled themſelves. It was the pious care of the Pilots of our Church, to conduct their Succeſſors (between the two rocks of Superſtition and Idolatry on one hand, and irreverence and irreligion on the other) in the ſame courſe in which (I hope we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) they themſelves went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And the Governors of the Church have ever ſince taken caution of all its Miniſters, not to depart from the ſame, either in their publick mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations or doctrines, ſo that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple need not doubt of their ſecurity in ſuch good old ways, wherein, as the ancient <hi>Martyrs</hi> did, they may even in the midſt of outward troubles, find peace in their Souls. But as for thoſe that give themſelves up to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Unſtable men, (who have degenerated not only from the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and charity of the ancient Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, but even from their own principles, and neither are what they lately were, nor have given their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers any ſecurity, that they will continue to be what now they are) They muſt needs be like children, toſſed to and

                  <p>But this reply is not thought ſufficient by learned Men, to ſilence the objection, to which it is anſwered more ſatisfactorily, as followeth. That <hi>S. Matthew</hi> was brought up in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, wherein that he was a good proficient, appears, as from many paſſages in that Goſpel, ſo eſpecially by the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, wherein he wrote it. In his time the coming of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by that Nation, and our Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entred on his publick Office, proclaims himſelf to be that <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and proves it, not only by the Divine Doctrine which he taught, but by the Miracles wrought by him, ſuch as no other Man did.

And this may help us to underſtand many places of Scripture, which without this knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew Idiom,</hi> ſeem very difficult, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> 7.22. <hi>I ſpake not to your Fathers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, but this thing commanded I them,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People,</hi> which cannot be underſtood, as if God had not commanded them concerning Sacrifices, but that he did not require them chiefly, or principally; Obedience being the duty which was moſt aimed at: So in the New Teſtament, <hi>John</hi> 7.16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me:</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize,</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99423:97"/>then, as it imports the publick worſhip of God, is not excluded. God that made our Souls and Bodies, requires that we ſhould glorifie him in our Souls and in our Bodies which are his, and that we may ſerve him acceptably,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 20.</note> he requireth outward reverence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note> as well as inward fear; and therefore to forſake the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of our ſelves, or in our Aſſemblies not to uſe that ſolemn Unity and reverence which may manifeſt our awful apprehenſions of that great Majeſty, with whom we have to do, and which may add a beauty to holineſs, is a gloſs beſides this Text, as if God had ſaid, <hi>Sacrificium nolo,</hi> I care not whether ye worſhip me publickly or no, whether it be at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or on mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> whether ye keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, whether ye agree in thoſe things which ye ſhall ask, or pray <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> or whether ye pray ſitting or ſtanding by your ſelves apart, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, as if God were indeed the Author of confuſion, and not of Peace and Order.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When God ſays <hi>Miſericordiam volo,</hi> He doth not exclude Juſtice,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</note> for though his tender Mercy be over all his works, yet the Judge of all the earth will do right. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Judgment were the two great ſtrings that ſounded ſo harmoniouſly in <hi>Davids</hi> Harp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.1. God requireth of us, firſt to do juſtice, and then to love mercy, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. If private perſons may defend their juſt rights, without violation of the rules of Charity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99423:98"/>much more may ſuch as are publick perſons, who may not ſhew mercy, but with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the publick peace and truth. By the Laws of God and man we are to give the precedence to acts of Juſtice, before the works of Mercy. He doth not hate his fleſh, that ſuffers a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green'd member to be cut off, <hi>I wiſh they were even cut off that trouble you,</hi>

When particular offenders grow obſtinate, and incorrigible, it is an act of Mercy to make them a Sacrifice to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick juſtice. If the offence be not capital, his puniſhment may be a means to reclaim him; if it be, the example of his ſufferings may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others from the like ſins, when <hi>they ſhall hear,</hi>

                     </label> To be buſie and ſcrupulous about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal worſhip of God, to the neglect of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties to God and our Brethren, is a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical</hi> temper, contrary to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>For the proof of which poſition, I ſhall weigh Mercy and Sacrifice in the ballance of the Sanctuary, that you may clearly ſee of what different eſteems they are in the ſight of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99423:98"/>God. And firſt, of Sacrifice, whoſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity might juſtly gain a great veneration among that people; for though I do not think it as ancient, as the ſtate of Innocency, (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and <hi>Greg. de Valentia</hi> (the better to countenance their Sacrifice of the Maſs) do affirm, <hi>Bellar. de miſſâ l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>Valent. de miſſae Sacrif. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.) yet it is almoſt as old as <hi>Adam,</hi> who taught his Sons to offer both of the fruits of the earth, and the fatlings of the Flock, which was done, as ſome learned men affirm, immediately upon that Covenant made to the promiſed ſeed, which was ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by Sacrifices, as the Apoſtle intimates. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. And the Skins wherewith we find <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> clothed, ſhortly after the fall, and which were afterward made the Prieſts portion, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.8. were given them by God, (he having firſt had the fleſh in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice) to be <hi>Symbolum propitiationis</hi> a ſign of that Propitiation by which their ſins were covered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sacrifices were of greater eſteem for their Inſtitution, than their Antiquity, God himſelf having commanded the ſeveral ſorts of them, and the particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concerning them. As firſt the Peace-offering, for the fruits of the earth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Sin-offering, for Atonement and pardon of Tranſgreſſions. Thirdly, the Burnt-offering, as an acknowledgment of Homage to God the Soveraign Lord of all. The book of <hi>Leviticus</hi> is but a Directory for theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99423:99"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, They were very conſiderable for their uſefulneſs. Firſt, as they were to be <hi>Signa innocentiae,</hi> teſtimonies and declarations of Innocency. For as the creatures offered unto God ought to be only ſuch as were clean for their kind, ſo particularly they ought to be without ſpot or blemiſh; and no beaſts or birds of prey, but the Ox and the Lamb; the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the Dove, harmleſs and uſeful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only, muſt be brought to the Altar, and the offerer was to lay his hands on the beaſt, either to profeſs his innocence, that he was not guilty of bribes or of bloud, of fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or if he were, then to confeſs his ſins, and deprecate the wrath of God by virtue of that Covenant, whereof the Sacrifice was a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and ſo it was propitiatory. They were, Secondly, Euchariſtical pledges, and earneſts of their gratitude, expreſſing their readineſs to forgoe all, or to return it to him from whom they received it. Thirdly, they were Admonitions to the guilty perſons, to repent of their ſins, or elſe that they muſt periſh as thoſe beaſts did.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By external Sacrifices they were minded of their internal duties, as <hi>mactare propriam voluntatem,</hi> to mortifie all beaſtly luſts and affections.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They were fences and boundaries to the Religion, God commanding the <hi>Jews</hi> to Sacrifice thoſe very beaſts which their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous neighbours did worſhip (as the Ox, the Sheep, and Dove, which were worſhipped
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99423:99"/>as Gods, among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Zabii</hi>) to maintain a greater deteſtation of Idolatry in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They were as ſo many penalties, and forfeitures, taken on that people upon every treſpaſs, which alſo ſerved, not only as a preſent puniſhment, but a future terror, minding them that they had forfeited their own lives and Souls, which God was pleaſed to ſpare, expecting better obedience, even a living Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>And yet all this notwithſtanding, though Sacrifices were venerable for their Antiquity, more for their uſefulneſs, as well to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in general, as to the Reformation of particular perſons, but moſt of all, for its divine Inſtution, the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law being but a Rubrick or directory for the Sacrifices, <hi>Miſericordiam volo, &amp;c. I will have mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if hypocritical <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all theſe Sacrifices in one, as the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.21. ſpeaks, <hi>Put your burnt-offerings to your Sacrifices and eat fleſh;</hi> If they ſhould go with their Flocks, and heards to ſeek the Lord, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.6. If they ſhould have preſented a Sacrifice as magnificent as that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 22000 Oxen, and 120000 Sheep; If they ſhould have invented more coſtly ones,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.63.</note> thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand rivers of Oil, their firſt-born for their tranſgreſſion, the fruit of their bodies, for the ſin of their Souls; yet to do juſtice, and to love mercy, is preferred to them all, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99423:100"/>
                  <p>For though Sacrifices were commanded, yet not for any intrinſical goodneſs in them, but with reſpect to ſome greater good. <hi>Eze.</hi> 20.25. <hi>I gave them Statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they ſhould not live,</hi> they were not originally good, as the duties of the Moral Law, theſe were commanded becauſe they were good, the other good only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were commanded, they did not make the Offerer, but he made them accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as in the caſe of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> Thus God ſpeaks to wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. that gave their mouths to evil,<note place="margin">ver. 19, 20.</note> and did ſit and ſpeak againſt their Brother and ſlander their own mothers ſon, <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices, or burnt-offerings, Offer to God Thanksgiving, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.16. <hi>Thou deſireſt not Sacrifice, elſe would I give it thee. The Sacrifices of God, are a broken Spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe. Solomon</hi> tells us [after that he had preſented that coſtly Sacrifice] <hi>To do juſtice and judgment, is more acceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice, Prov.</hi> 21.3. for it is true of the houſe of God, what he ſays of ours, <hi>Better is a dry morſel with quietneſs, than a houſe full of Sacrifices with ſtrife, Prov.</hi> 17.1. In this therefore, the young Scribe was better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed than theſe Phariſees, for he conſented with our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.33. <hi>That to love the Lord, with all our heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and our neighbours as our ſelves, is more than all whole burnt-offerings, and Sacrifice,</hi> In a word, our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99423:100"/>Saviour hath told us, that whatever our gift be that we bring to the Altar, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that our Brother hath ought againſt us, <hi>(i.)</hi> if we are conſcious of any injury, or unkindneſs, wherewith he may charge us, it is our duty to go firſt, and be reconciled to our Brother, before we preſume to offer our gift, though it be of prayer, or praiſe; God will never accept of a peace-offering, from them that live in enmity with their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>And now if I ſhould put into this ſcale, the whole Oeconomy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſcipline, their Oblations and Incenſe, their New Moons and Sabbaths, their calling of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies (for Feaſts or Faſts,) and their Prayers too, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.11. they would for want of mercy be found too light. <hi>To what purpoſe are they?</hi> ſaith God, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> v. 12. <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations, incenſe is an abomination to me, I cannot away with it, it is iniquity even your ſolemn meetings,</hi> ver. 13. they were eſteemed but mock ſervices by God, for want of mercy to their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Two other inſtances I ſhall add, becauſe they ſeem of great weight.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That of Circumciſion, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> by which he promiſed to be his God and the God of his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. and the Apoſtle-calls it a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. And as God inſtituted it, ſo he commanded the obſervation of it by a ſevere Sanction. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed was to be cut off, Gen.</hi> 17.14.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99423:101"/>And the Rabbies tell us, that as God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deſtroying Angels to that end, ſo he aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guardian Angels to every one that was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. Certain it is, that they bearing the marks and tokens of Gods Covenant in their fleſh, did boaſt themſelves to be Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people. And as our Apoſtle intimates, they preferred it to the Croſs of Chriſt which the Apoſtle, though he himſelf was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, abhors with an <hi>abſit, Gal.</hi> 6. ver. 14. But it was a ſaying among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was equal to the keeping of the whole Law, and that Heaven &amp; Earth could not ſtand if Circumciſion were omitted, therefore they made the eight days before Circumciſion to be a preparation for that ſolemnityat which they invited their friends as witneſſes and Sponſors for the child, that he ſhould obſerve the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in the later times, had always an empty Chair ſet for <hi>Elias,</hi> expecting that he ſhould deſcend from Heaven to be a witneſs of the Circumciſion; and yet in truth it was as the Apoſtle ſaith, a a burthen which neither they nor their Fathers could bear, and therefore God himſelf diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the uſe of it to this people forty years together in the wilderneſs;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10.</note> and though St. <hi>Paul</hi> was Circumciſed, and to make his own and <hi>Timothy</hi>'s miniſtry the more acceptable to that people,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 16.1.</note> took <hi>Timothy</hi> and Circumciſed him, yet he teacheth them that if they were Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with an intention to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the works of the Law, Chriſt ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99423:101"/>profit them nothing: And <hi>Galatians</hi> 6.15. (to them that were) <hi>in Christ Jeſus, neither circumciſion availed any thing, neither uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but a new creature;</hi> by which he underſtands, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>faith which worketh by love:</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>a keeping the Commandments of God:</hi> ſo that circumciſion was not to be contended for, when the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel, or Charity came into competition with it.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond inſtance ſhall be that of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, of the profanation whereof the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> complained to Chriſt of his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.2. and for whoſe vindication our Saviour urgeth again the right underſtanding of this Text, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Chriſt's Diſciples (as well as himſelf) were circumciſed, and ſo obliged to ſanctifie the Sabbath according to the Commandment, and great were the puniſhments which God threatned and inflicted on the tranſgreſſors, ſuch as ſtruck a terror to them, which made them run into ſuperſtition, inſomuch that they would not go out of their places, nor dreſs their meat, nor carry a ſtick, nor defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their enemies on that day. And the crime for which the Diſciples were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, was rather for tranſgreſſing their tradition, than any precept of God; for if the fault was their walking through the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, it doth not appear that they exceeded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99423:102"/>2000. Cubits, which was allowed by them for a Sabbath-days Journey; if plucking the ears of Corn, that was approved by the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.25. If for eating (which ſeemeth moſt probable, becauſe our Saviour anſwered the objection by the inſtance of <hi>David</hi>'s eating the ſhew-bread) yet being hungry, their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity might excuſe them, nor was this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden (though perhaps contrary to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practice of theirs, for which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upbraided them, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> their Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Faſts) therefore Chriſt vindicates, them, as guiltleſs upon the plea in the Text, <hi>I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees do not underſtand the ſubſtantial and ſpiritual part of your own Law, for as long as there is not contumacy or contempt in the neglect of Ceremonial Precepts, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of a juſt neceſſity, or the rational conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a greater good to out-weigh that neglect, God will not impute it as a ſin. Of this our Saviour convinceth them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>David, v.</hi> 4. and of the Prieſts in the Temple, profaning the Sabbath by dreſſing the Sacrifices, for they were wont to ſay— <hi>In the Temple there is no Sabbath.</hi> If then the ſervice of the Temple excuſed the Prieſts for profaning the Sabbath; the ſervice of Chriſt who tells them of himſelf, that he was greater than the Temple, <hi>v.</hi> 6. might excuſe his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who being Prophets and Preachers of the Kingdom of Heaven, were greater than the Prieſts of the Law, as our Saviour ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.11.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99423:102"/>
                  <p>Now a Prophet even under the Law, was above the Law of the Temple, and might ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in any place, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, and therefore it could not be unlawful for Chriſt's Diſciples, ſo earneſtly attending his work, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hungry, having no other proviſion, to eat a few grains of Corn for their preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Again, our Saviour tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, which that he ſpeaks of himſelf as the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (who had power to abrogate and alter the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) is the opinion of ſome, though not ſo clear, becauſe <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.20. he would not have it yet known that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and if our Saviour had made this his argument he needed not to have uſed any other. Others therefore think that by the Son of Man is meant <hi>every Son of Man,</hi> for Chriſt himſelf was not blamed but his Diſciples, whom he pronounceth guiltleſs for this reaſon, <hi>The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> which S. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſeth more plainly to this purpoſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man:</hi> and ſo the argument ſtands thus, That which was made for another thing is to give place to that for which it was made, but <hi>the Sabbath was made for man, ergo, &amp;c.</hi> Now though the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo ſuperſtitious, that even in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> they would not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their enemies on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, yet ſhortly after they began to grow wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and would not only deſend their own Lives, but aſſault their enemies, and do any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99423:103"/>neceſſary work; for they had dearly been taught this Maxime, <hi>Periculum vitae diſſolvit Sabbatum,</hi> that the danger of loſing Life did diſſolve the Sabbath: And as <hi>Selden, de Jure Gentium, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. they held that in caſe of ſickneſs, a <hi>Jew</hi> might not only eat forbidden Meats, but for recovery of health, or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any great danger, he might break any commandment, except theſe three, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Murther, and Inceſt; and I have heard from the mouth of a modern <hi>Jew,</hi> an odd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of that Text, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.4. which he interpreting the copulative, by a diſcretive, reads, <hi>Keep the commandments, but live;</hi> i. e. ſo keep the commandments, as to be careful of preſerving thy life in keeping of them. But to return in our Saviour's time, it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them, as a thing lawful on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.15.</note> to pluck an Oxe or an Aſs out of a Ditch, or to lead them to Water, and to permit Merchants and Carriers to travel about their neceſſary affairs on that Day. So that the ſum of all is this, that when two Laws ſeemed to interfere, ſo as both could not be kept, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer muſt yield to the greater, the ritual and ceremonial, to the moral or evangelical, which is the ſenſe of the Text: <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, What is this of the contention of the <hi>Jews</hi> for Ceremonies, to the contending of Chriſtians againſt them, when they are impoſed contrary to their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty?</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99423:103"/>

(i.e.) it is lawful for a Chriſtian to do thoſe things, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which nothing of moment can be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Scriptures, or right reaſon, to prove them unlawful. Thoſe Men therefore go the wrong way, and puzle their own and other Mens conſciences, who argue, It is not commanded, therefore I may not do it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ought to argue, It is not forbidden, therefore I may do it without prejudice to my Chriſtian liberty: although it may be truly ſaid, that it is commanded of God <hi>(in genere)</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and <hi>(in specie)</hi> by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which we are bound to yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for conſcience ſake, not as if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Superiors did immediately bind the conſcience in ſuch caſes, but by vertue of God's commands for obedience to the higher

                  <p>Again, we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> commending the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 1 Epiſtle, Ch. 11. v. 2. for keeping the Ordinances which he delivered them, that is, ſay our Annotators, particular Ordinances for comelineſs and good order, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Eccleſiaſtical Polity, and were afterward called Canous, againſt which, if any but only ſeemed to be contentious by diſputing againſt them, the Apoſtle ſilenced them by that, in Verſ. 16. <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God,</hi> that is, ſay the ſame Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, to contend about matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but willingly and cheerfully to obey thoſe that have the over-ſight of us in the Lord. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99423:104"/>it is fit to conſider the nature of the matter treated of, which was, how Men and Women ought to behave themſelves at publick Prayers, which behaviour the Apoſtle would have to agree with thoſe ſigns and geſtures of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which Subjects are wont to yield to their Princes:<note place="margin">Cameron. in loc.</note> and although the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with their Heads covered, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſign of reverence among them, as alſo do the <hi>Turks</hi> to this day ſit covered, and bowing their Bodies at their Devotions, as they are wont to do in the preſence of their Rulers; yet the Apoſtle being to plant the Church among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> with whom the uncovering of the Head was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of reverence, he appoints the ſame beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Worſhip of God.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall ever ſuſpect that Religion, that teacheth Men to love God, and hate their Brethren with all their heart.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder if the Stoicks, that deny the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99423:106"/>Deity, and aſcribe all to an inexorable fate, do alſo unman Humanity, and unbowel Virtue, teaching that a wiſe Man ought to caſt away all compaſſion, and making that a defect of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> bearing one anothers burthens, which a better Philoſopher ſays,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.2.</note> is to fulfill the Law of Chriſt. Well might <hi>Cicero</hi> reject them; <hi>(neque enim audiendi ſunt, qui virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem duram, &amp; ferream eſſe volunt)</hi> as not fit to be heard, who would transform Virtue, which is of a gentle, tender, tractable, and yielding quality, into a rigid, ſtupid, implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unſociable conſtitution: Such wiſe Men have as little brains, as bowels, ſeeing St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> And thus, though I have but caſually let fall ſome drops of Mercy into the other ſcale, you may perceive how much they do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſcipline and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.

                     <hi>neither are my ways your ways; for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts,</hi> ſaith the Lord. What great things the mercy of God will effect for ſuch as love him, may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear by the things he works in them, and by them, whom he cauſeth to partake of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99423:106"/>own ſpirit, and ſo ſheds abroad his love into their hearts, that they can extend it again throughout the whole World, and be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>as their Heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> even in that great inſtance of making (as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>the ſun of righteouſneſs to ſhine, and the Dew of Heaven to fall upon the just and the unjust,</hi> and by their compaſſionate deſires, and faithful prayers, their tender mercies are over all the works of God. How gladly could I caſt my ſelf into this Ocean, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> to <hi>Euripus,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Quoniam ego non Comprehendam te, tu Comprehendes me;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot comprehend thy mercies, Lord, let me be comprehended of them!</p>
                  <p>But as every duſt of Gold is Gold, ſo every act of mercy is precious, and therefore I ſhall not need to mention the infinite perfections of Divine mercy, nor thoſe Heroick deeds of merciful Men, whoſe love hath been more ſtrong than Death; but confine my ſelf within thoſe ordinary bounds of Charity, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian may and ought to converſe with other, ſuch as the Apoſtle names, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. To be long-ſuffering, and kind, not to envy, or vaunt themſelves, not to be puffed up, and ſeek their own, not to be eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, not to think or ſpeak evil: any of theſe defects will, as the want of Salt to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, make it corrupt, and become unſavory. Every malicious thought will be as ſo much fire, to make them evaporate into ſmoke. So the Apoſtle aſſures us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Though I spake with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99423:107"/>the tongue of men and Angels,</hi> though I had the gift of Prophecie, and underſtand all My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and knowledge, and had all Faith, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing. The bare omiſſion of the meaneſt acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſuch as our Saviour mentioneth, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> 25.25. is ſufficient to exclude our Souls as well as our Services from Heaven. The Phariſees then, had little reaſon to inſiſt ſo exactly on a <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremony of touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and accompanying with unclean perſons; when they admitted that pride and contempt of their brethren, that envy againſt Chriſt, which rendred them by far the more unclean. A principle which hath much troubled the Church of God in all ages, when <hi>Phariſaical</hi> men, firſt cenſure and condemn their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and then ſeparate from them, and grow in hatred againſt them, when they have no other reaſon to think ill of their Brethren, but becauſe they think too well of themſelves; and by their zeal for the externals of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeek to palliate their neglect of the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential duties. To theſe our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Leſſon in the Text (as well as to thoſe ancient <hi>Phariſees</hi>) <hi>Go learn what that meaneth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Having endeavoured to convince your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the truth of the propoſition in general, I ſhall apply it as effectually as I can for the cure of our preſent diſtempers, for we alſo do trouble our ſelves, and others, about many-inconſiderable circumſtances of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99423:107"/>Worſhip, to the neglect of thoſe moral duties of Humility, Charity and peace, which are of the very Eſſence of Religion. And I doubt not but if we would lay aſide our pride, prejudice, and carnal intereſt, and as new-born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that we might grow thereby, this plain Leſſon of our Saviour, touching the <hi>Love of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> would more edifie us as well in holineſs, as in peace and love, than all the publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations or private inſinuations of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, whoſe zeal (like the little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent heat in Inſects, which not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to form ſound vitals within, runs out into many weak and uſeleſs members and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth (an <hi>Ephemeron</hi>) an Animal that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but for a day) running out into many nice circumſtances, may have ſomething of the ſhew, but very little of the ſubſtance and life of Religion. To ſuch I do in the fear of God propoſe this method of learning the Leſſon in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That our Agreement in the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion, and the liberty to profeſs and practiſe all things neceſſary to Godlineſs and Salvation, ought to be an indiſſoluble bond of peace and unity to us all. As the lower Sphears, though they have a proper tendency of their own, yet yield to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the higher Orb; ſo though we have ſome fond conceits, and ſmall concerns of our own, we ſhould forſake them to comply with the great ends of Religion, Mercy, and Peace.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99423:108"/>We agree in the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, in the Creed, and Commandments, in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the Sacraments; we are built on the Foundation of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.</note> and on this Foundation we may build as high as Heaven, why ſhould our Pride and Contention pull down the Judgment of <hi>Babel</hi> upon us? Methinks there ſhould be no place left for diſcord among Brethren that are united by ſo many Obligations, one Lord, one Faith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5.</note> one Baptiſm, one God, one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all: but though we all pretend to meet in the ſame Center, yet the Leaders in every Faction (as the Lines that are protracted to the greateſt length) are fartheſt from recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
                  <p>Though others murmur and will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with <hi>Manna</hi> except they may have their fleſh-pots too, Let us bleſs God, that he hath eſtabliſhed truth and righteouſneſs among us by a Law.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127.20</note> He hath not dealt ſo with other Nations, nor was it ſo with us of late days, and we may juſtly fear that our ingratitude and contentions may reduce us to the like confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God himſelf will diſpenſe with all the externals of his Worſhip, to ſhew us mercy, we need not fear his diſpleaſure, if we either omit ſome things that pleaſe us, or admit ſome other things that diſpleaſe us in the outward adminiſtrations, for the freer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mercy and peace: better it is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a doubtful inconvenience, than to run
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99423:108"/>into a certain miſchief. And it will never be accounted among our infirmities, that we were not more careful of the publick Worſhip of God, than he himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Neither the external circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Worſhip which are injoyned, nor thoſe which are contended for, in oppoſition to them, have any poſitive command from God, or our Saviour; for our Saviour hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the circumſtances of Divine Worſhip, foreſeeing (as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays) that the ſame Rites would not agree with the ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Inſtit. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi> n. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> and Ages, wherein the Church ſhould be planted; and if we conſider that whereas the Two Sacraments only are poſitively inſtituted in the New Teſtament, there have been ſo great controverſies moved about them; that many large Volumes have been written, and many bloudy Battles fought by men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minds, it will appear a great mercy, that other things did not come under precept; for then, greater pretences for maintaining differences would have been pleaded; which now have no colour, for as much as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in diſpute fall not under any command, and if there be no command, it follows that they are left at liberty, but by offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt plain Commands, for obedience and peace, our ſin and condemnation are the greater.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This ſhall be a Fourth conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that whatever cannot be referred to Faith or good manners, and is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99423:109"/>nor forbidden, that may be done or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as is moſt conducible to the great ends of peace, Charity, and Unity. To evince the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of an action, theſe things are ſufficient, Firſt, that there be no command injoyning or forbidding it. <hi>2ly.</hi> That it be declared by the Magiſtrate impoſing it, that it is not intended as a part of Divine Worſhip, as having an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent neceſſity, (and ſo becomes an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty,) but for Order, Decency and Unity, and therefore as the Caſuiſts ſay, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra contemptum &amp; ſcandalum,</hi> if the Superiors authority be not deſpiſed, nor our Brethren ſcandalized, the practice of ſuch things may be omitted, as you know the Ceremonies may be, in caſe of neceſſity, and in private duties, which could not be if they were not things indifferent. So that, that part of the Churches declaration, that ſays, ſhe hath power to add, alter, or abrogate ſuch Rites, manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares their indifferency, as <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, ſpeaking of the Sacramental Bread, whether it be Levened or unlevened, and the Wine, whether Red or White, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into every mans hand by the Deacon, or not. <hi>Haec indifferentia ſunt &amp; in Eccleſiae libertate poſita.</hi> The Inſtitutions and practice of the Church are a ſufficient rule for ſuch practices. The not preſcribing them in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, argueth that it was as unneceſſary as impoſſible to be done: for as to that rule of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ro.</hi> 14.23</note> that <hi>whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> it imports not, that we either ſhould
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99423:109"/>have a command for every action in the Word of God, or that the thing done, is in it ſelf pleaſing to God, but, if it be not forbidden, nor really evil, but is in order to other good ends, it may or may not be done, (without a Superſtitious fear of offending God,) by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In all things not determined by the Word of God, we are bound to obey the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, by virtue of the general Commands of God, and otherwiſe the Magiſtrate ſhould have no authority at all,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> for thoſe things which are good in their own nature, are commanded by God, and therefore the Magiſtrate muſt have power in things not commanded, or he hath none at all: and ſo in things forbidden, which will more plainly appear by what followeth,</p>
                  <p>For, Sixthly, If I may do, or not do things in their nature indifferent, rather than offend a weak Brother, (which is the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Plea to the Conformiſts) much more ought I ſo to do, or not do, rather than offend a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, or diſturb the publick peace, becauſe publick offences are more carefully to be avoided than private, and when the Magiſtrates command is added (whether he be Civil or Eccleſiaſtical) that which was but lawful before, becomes, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> neceſſary, as a means to peace or edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.20. It is certainly more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to oppoſe the command of many wiſe men (and ſuch perhaps as are intruſted by us) or which is the ſame thing to go againſt their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99423:110"/>judgment, and offend their Conſciences, than to go againſt the judgment, and offend the Conſciences of a few weak Brethren, who neither have the advantages to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the nature of things, nor that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or concern, to provide for the publick peace, as their Superiours have, but may be eaſily impoſed on, by crafty men that lay in wait to deceive. Judge in your ſelves Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren how intolerable would that Servant be in your Family that ſhould be always quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at his Maſters habit, or the directions given him for his work; and though he have good and wholſom food in plenty, yet diſlikes the Cookery, and being reproved for his pride and curioſity, is obſtinate and inſtigates his fellow-ſervants to deſert the Family. But herein the Apoſtles example may direct us better how far we may, or may not do things indifferent, (and ſuch as have ſome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil in them to others) rather than to give offence to a Brother, as in the caſe of meats, which had been declared unclean by the Law, (but that difference was by the Goſpel abrogated) and were much more accounted pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by having been offered unto Idols, yet the Apoſtle ſays,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</note> 
                     <hi>meat commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worſe,</hi> it is grace and not meat by which the heart is eſtabliſhed; our Chriſtian liberty is an Amulet againſt any corruption in ſuch things, for though the practice be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the judgment is free, there is <hi>libertas ad op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99423:110"/>So in the caſe of Circumciſion before mentioned, which was ſo abrogated, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>if ye be circumciſed (i. e.</hi> with an opinion ſays, <hi>if ye be circumciſed (i. e.</hi> with an opinion of the legal neceſſity of it) <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.</note> Yet to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he might win them, he became as a <hi>Jew,</hi> and then uſed Circumciſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.3. and to them that were without the Law, as without Law, that he might win the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and then he would not Circumciſe, and in all this he was Chriſts Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though he made himſelf a ſervant to all.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle knew that his Chriſtian liberty was founded in freedom of Judgment and not of practice, and that neither <hi>Circumciſion nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion</hi> were any thing,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19.</note> but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandments. Now no actions of ours that are required in obedience to our Superiours about the Publick Worſhip, are ſo obnoxious to cenſure and ſcandal, as theſe were, but are under our Chriſtian liberty. And as we ought to ſerve one another in love, in obedience to Gods commands; ſo ought we in obedience of the ſame, to <hi>ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> and not uſe our liberty as a Cloke of Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or an occaſion to the fleſh, to caſt off either our Love to our Brethren or Obedience to Magiſtrates. For to what end hath God, according to his promiſe, raiſed up Kings, to be Nurſing Fathers to his Church, or what poſſibility is there, that they ſhould provide for its peace, if they have not power in theſe External things? If therefore the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99423:111"/>be indifferent, it is certain that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Magiſtrate is no indifferent thing, but as neceſſary, as peace and unity, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be preſerved.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The means are alway, as ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient, ſo inferior to the end: Now the end of the Commandment is Charity, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Col. 3.14.</note> and therefore both he, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> require charity above all things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. When therefore theſe externals of religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come apples of contention, they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, which cannot be injoyed without the breach of the great Commandment: and if they had each of them a particular precept; yet when leſſer duties come in competition with greater, they ceaſe to oblige. Private Laws yield to publick, humane Laws to the Laws of God; and among God's Laws, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Precepts yield to thoſe that are moral and natural; A Vow, or an Oath concerning a thing lawful, if it hinder <hi>Majus bonum Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale,</hi> ceaſeth to oblige. The <hi>Corban</hi> might not be pleaded in Bar, to the relieving of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; much leſs may any Covenant oblige, againſt the Peace of the Church, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Parent (as ſome ſtill plead, for that which they call the National Covenant.) Thoſe things therefore which are matters of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and external order, how preciſely ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever injoyned, ought to give place to thoſe that are the more ſubſtantial parts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as mercy and obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, charity, peace, and unity among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99423:111"/>and as we may diſuſe ſome things which have been generally received in the Church of God, (as were the kiſs of charity, the love-feaſts, and anointing of the Sick) ſo certainly we may uſe ſome other things, which are injoyned by our Superiors, for the ſake of Order, and Unity. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the Doctrine of Faith in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> he tells them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.16.</note> that if about rites and ceremonies, <hi>Any man ſeem to be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God:</hi> that is, the cuſtom of the Church is a ſufficient Plea againſt ſuch contentious perſons. Thus when the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had compoſed the Articles of Faith in that Creed, they all with one conſent approved of the Ancient rites and cuſtomes: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſays, it was ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed an unreaſonable thing for thoſe that agreed in the Subſtantials of Religion,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>, to ſeparate from each other, for cuſtomes, and matters of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputation.</p>
                  <p>And it is generally agreed, that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which are <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> agreeing in the ſame Faith, may differ in Rites and Ceremonies, which they have power to alter, or abrogate, and therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays, they are <hi>Mali filii,</hi> wicked Sons, that will diſturb the Peace of the Church, their Mother, for ſuch external rites, and as the Phariſees in the Text ſeek to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the Diſciples by ſuch objections againſt their Maſter, <hi>Why eateth your Maſter with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99423:112"/>Publicans and Sinners?</hi> And yet certain it is, that the Authors of Sects and Diviſions among us, have no better grounds for all the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and confuſion, the proud contempt, and unchriſtian cenſures, the ſlander and vexation, that have been as ſo many evil ſpirits raiſed among us; and I deſire, that ſuch as are yet in the fault, would not only conſider the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the grounds, but alſo the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous conſequences of our diviſions, how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to our Saviour's rule in the Text, <hi>I will have mercy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that there are Diviſions among us, may be proved by the ſame arguments, that the Apoſtle uſeth to prove, that there were Diviſions in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>

                     <hi>(viz.)</hi> when one ſaith, <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and another, <hi>I am of Apollos, &amp;c.</hi> which Diviſions, as they cannot be warranted, but on a ſuppoſition of ſome great corruption in our Doctrine, or Worſhip, or ſome grand profaneneſs in our Members; ſo are they not raiſed without ſuch thoughts in the hearts of thoſe that do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from us, as Mr. <hi>Newcomen</hi> obſerved in his Sermon at St. <hi>Pauls, Febr.</hi> 8. 1646. <hi>p.</hi> 40. <q rend="margQuotes">Who are they that brand their Brethren with the title of Proud, Time-ſervers, Prelatical, Tyrannical, Antichriſtian, but ſuch as ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate?

Why do they upon ſo ſmall differences, withdraw from Communion with us, and gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into diſtinct and ſeparate Churches?</q> This is certainly a phariſaical leaven, that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and imbitters our ſpirits, and though the effects of it may be hid for a time, yet on every heat and agitation it ſpreads through the whole lump, and ſwells Men with Pride, and an unſociable ſowrneſs of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And though the things wherein we differ, ſeem to be but ſmall, and have a ſhew of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet the conſequences are ſo notoriouſly and really evil, that the moſt zealous preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the Diſcipline of Chriſt, are too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Plaiſter to cover or cure the feſtred rancor and malice towards his members. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are no fit matter to exerciſe our zeal and contention, but obedience and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Yet as the Ordinances and Rites that were retained by the believing <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> were ſtill a Wall of ſeparation between them, and the Apoſtle calls it <hi>the enmity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.15.</note> ſo is it with us: The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered chiefly about the place wherein they ought to Worſhip, upon which there grew a mortal hatred between them, ſo as that there was no commerce between them, they would not ſalute one another.—<hi>Nec monſtrare vias eadem niſi Sacra colenti;</hi> and it was accounted all one to be a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and to have a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
